<i>uhea oe, Nalima? Elua nahae hou
    o kuu lole!</i>"<a name="ft1" id="ft1"></a><a href="#f1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
"<i>Auwe, pela?</i>"<a name="ft2" id="ft2"></a><a href="#f2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> replied
the old woman addressed, taking
at the same time from Kalani's
hands a coat that might best be
described as one of many colors.
The old man seated himself on the floor of the little
hut, and gazed at this same coat in a manner
savoring of dejection. "Yes," he said, "while I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_6" id="page_6">[6]</a></span>
was digging around the taro down by the stream,
I left it hanging on a branch of the big kukui
tree, but when I returned to put it on, I found
that it had blown off, caught on a piece of
bark and torn that hole. Do you think you can
mend it so that I can wear it on Sunday? You
know I have no other. <i>Pilikia maoli!</i>" (sad
plight), and Kalani gave a grunt that embodied
many emotions.</p>
<p class="note"><a name="f1" id="f1"></a><a href="#ft1">[1]</a>: "Where are you, Nalima? Here are two new rents in my clothes!"</p>

<p class="note"><a name="f2" id="f2"></a><a href="#ft2">[2]</a>: "Oh dear! is that so?" </p>

<p>Nalima's small, slightly withered hands were
turning the coat tenderly. Patch had already
been placed upon patch, nearly every one differing
in material and color from the original fabric,
which was a cotton twill, and the bleachings of
sun and soap had added variety in many shades
of blue and brown.</p>

<p>Yes, she had a little piece of blue flannel left
that would just fit this new rent, she mused, and
the whole thing must be washed again. She was
sure she could have it ready to wear that same
night. This hopeful view enabled her old husband
to start again with his <i>o-o</i> (Hawaiian spade)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_7" id="page_7">[7]</a></span>
for the garden patch. He removed his tattered
hat as he went, revealing a head of fine proportions.
The forehead was high and full, and the
top bald and shining. Soft, white locks clustered
in his neck, and a white beard several inches
in length gave a distinguished look to his face.
Patience looked from his soft dark eyes and the
expression about his mouth was kind and firm.
The small rush mat which Nalima had been
braiding when Kalani arrived with his tale of
woe was laid aside, and, from a very meager
supply of housewifely stores, a needle, thread,
and bit of flannel were produced. Her dim eyes
strained themselves to adjust the patch to the
torn edges, and her trembling hands set the
stitches with patient effort. Meanwhile the
thoughts of the old wife wandered into the past.
The long-ago was a happy time to re-live. When
they were young, in Kauikeaouli's time, Kalani
had been a <i>kanaka nui</i> (great man) among Hawaiians.
He had been a <i>luna</i> (overseer) in their
valley and had directed the <i>konohiki</i> (chief's resident
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_8" id="page_8">[8]</a></span>
land-agent) labor for years. His own <i>kuliana</i>
(land-holding) was a large one, and the
rights of the stream for some acres were
his. He in his turn controlled the work of others
for himself. Their house was large and high
and had a window of glass in one end; the
<i>hikie</i> (bedstead) was a pile of mats soft and
fine, and the bedding was of the finest <i>kapa</i>.<a name="ft3" id="ft3"></a><a href="#f3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
There was always a plenty of <i>poi</i><a name="ft4" id="ft4"></a><a href="#f4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> in the calabash;
ti roots, kukui-nuts, cocoa-nuts and breadfruit
abounded for more delicate dishes. They themselves
were well and strong, and oh! how proud
they were of their boy and girl. Like a dream
had been the years between. Sovereign had succeeded
sovereign. Epidemics has decimated the
people. The <i>konohiki</i> labor had lapsed.
Strangers had leased the lands, fences now barred
the way, and keys effectually locked the fastnesses
from the ramblers and seekers for shells and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_9" id="page_9">[9]</a></span>
ferns. Their own acres had been cajoled away
from them, and only this little hut far up the
valley, and a small plot of land, on which they
with difficulty raised a little <i>taro</i> and a few sweet
potatoes, remained. They were allowed to retain
possession of this as compensation for guarding
the leased lands of the valley against trespassers,
but they received no money. The children had
grown and gone. The daughter had married and
lived a few years at Kona, Hawaii, then died.
The son had braved the Arctic cold and had been
a sailor for years on a whale ship. But many,
many moons had passed since his last visit home;
probably he, too, was dead. They themselves
were growing old now; they had no chance to
earn money; economy had crystallized for them
into the problem of how long they could make
things last. Kalani would be broken-hearted
when his coat was too old to wear to church, for,
rain or sun, he faithfully attended the service at
the mouth of the valley every Sunday afternoon,
walking several miles to do so. While Nalima
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_10" id="page_10">[10]</a></span>
sewed and mused, Kalani, wrestling with mountain
<i>nahelehele</i> (wild growth) was thinking
too. Perhaps the vigor in the arm that
drove the <i>o-o</i> into the grass stirred the
thought cells in his head; the mental result,
however, was not retrospection, but determination
to do some thing in the immediate
future to help the present condition of
affairs. "I <i>must</i> have a new coat. I cannot wear
my old one to church any longer. I have no
money, but perhaps some one will give me clothes
if I ask for them. I have never begged, and
Nalima wouldn't let me beg now if she knew
about it; I musn't tell her. It is more than two
years since I have been beyond the church, but
there are <i>haole</i> (foreign) families living not far
from there, and I'll go to them. I'll tell Nalima
I'm going to try to sell some eggs, we've got six
saved in the pail, and perhaps I can buy some
salmon to bring home to her. It would taste
good (<i>ono loa</i>) to her. I'll go tomorrow morning."
And, full of his resolve, Kalani shouldered
his o-o and returned to his hut.</p>

<p>"Ruth, please see who is knocking at the side
door," said Mrs. Hamilton early one morning in
the month of August. "It's a native man, Mamma,"
said Ruth a moment later, "he wants to see you,
but says he can wait until you can come. I
think he has never been here before; he is very
old; and he has a small tin pail with him." When
Mrs. Hamilton opened the door leading to the
veranda, the rising sun was glorifying a strip of
lawn, glancing among young orange trees, glowing
along an hibiscus hedge, and giving an effect
beyond description to a golden-shower tree in
full bloom. On either side of the steps leading
to the drive, banks of ferns stood crisp and cool.
The grass was bright with fairy rainbows strung
on drops of dew.  "Oh, what a morning to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_12" id="page_12">[12]</a></span>
be alive!" thought Mrs. Hamilton, "what, I
wonder, will be the first thing given me to do
this beautiful day?" From the lower step arose,
at this instant, Kalani. With the grace and dignity
natural to the Hawaiian, he bared his head,
and, holding his tattered hat in his hand, gave the
friendly salutation "Aloha" which Mrs. Hamilton
returned in as friendly a tone. Noting in an
instant the splendid proportions of his head, his
fine brow, and the character which shone from
every feature of his up-turned face, it was with
the sincerest interest that she asked in Hawaiian,
"What can I do for you, what would you like?"
Kalani took a step sideways into the ferns, still
looking up into her eyes, and, with various apologetic
expressions flitting across his face, finally
took hold of the lapel of his coat with his left
hand and, drawing it slightly forward, said, "I
didn't know but perhaps you had a cast-off coat
that you would be willing to give me. This one
is very old and has many holes. If I had a
better one I should wear it to church and that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_13" id="page_13">[13]</a></span>
would be <i>maikai loa</i> (very pleasant), but, if not,
never mind, it will be all right" (<i>like pu, he maikai
no ia</i>). Mrs. Hamilton's quick eye took in at
a glance the entire suit in which this son of the
soil stood. His garments showed their many
patches, and she thought that the colors of the
remnants still clinging together, would be difficult
to reproduce upon any painter's palette.
Stepping within the bedroom door she found
Mr. Hamilton adjusting his necktie before the
mirror. "George," she said, "do you suppose you
have a second-hand coat I might give this man?
He needs one badly enough. There is something
singularly appealing about him, and, you can see
in a moment, he is no beggar."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess so," said Mr. Hamilton, first taking
a glance through the door at Kalani and then
proceeding to his wardrobe. Presently he returned
and handed his wife an entire suit of grey woolen
clothes. "My," said she, "he has asked only for
a <i>coat</i>! I'll give them to him one by one. Come
out and enjoy the good time with me." Returning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_14" id="page_14">[14]</a></span>
to the veranda she held up the coat. "Do you
suppose this will fit you?" she asked. "Oh yes,
yes!" was the quick reply, "you must see for
yourself," and his hands trembled as he carefully
withdrew the delicate coat he wore from his
shoulders. "See, see, it fits, it fits!" (<i>Ku no,
ku no!</i>) and his hands stroked down the sleeves,
and lovingly patted the pocket flaps.</p>

<p>His expressions of delight and appreciation
were cut short by Mrs. Hamilton's holding up the
trousers. "What do you think about these?"
Kalani shot a lightning glance at Mr. Hamilton,
who stood on the veranda enjoying the scene,
and said "Oh, yes, we are just the same size."
"He," pointing to Mr. Hamilton, "isn't any bigger
than I am." Taking the trousers, the old man
avowed most solemnly that they would be just
right (<i>ku pono loa</i>). "Besides," said he with a
look of conscious pride, "I've got an old wife who
can fix them if they are not." So that point was
settled. The vest was now held up. "Of course
you don't want this," said Mrs. Hamilton, "it will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_15" id="page_15">[15]</a></span>
make you too warm." "A vest, a vest!" he cried,
"no it <ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'wont'">won't</ins>, oh, I shall be too proud for anything,
(<i>hookano maoli</i>) to have a vest!"</p>

<p>All three were laughing by this time, Kalani
as much as the others. "Dear me," said Mr.
Hamilton, "this is getting interesting. I must
see if I can't find him something else." In a
moment he was back with a neat, striped negligee
shirt, which he himself offered the old man. The
expression on the shining face of the native as he
received this fresh gift, was something to remember.
It was brother looking into brother's
face, with a something too deep for words. It
was an expression that one would like to meet
again, in the world beyond.</p>

<p>"Let's give him a hat," said George Jr., who
had joined the group on the veranda, "there are
a lot on the hat-tree to spare." The tattered hat
under Kalani's arm had not spoken in vain. As
the boy was searching for one, his father cried to
him, "Bring the silk hat from the top peg." "No,
no," said Mrs. Hamilton, "don't let us spoil a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_16" id="page_16">[16]</a></span>
good thing by allowing the old man to think we
are making fun of him." "Fun of him!" said Mr.
Hamilton, "I tell you I know what will please his
soul, and it's a silk hat, now see if it's not."
George first handed his mother a brown derby,
only slightly the worse for wear, and then a silk
hat still possessed of a good shine but not the
most modern in shape. Having only the first in
evidence, Mrs. Hamilton again addressed Kalani.
"Do you think you could wear this hat?" "That
hat for me? Oh how fine! Yes, yes, I know&mdash;"
here his words failed, for his eyes had caught
sight of the silk hat, which Mr. Hamilton was in
a great hurry to prove would be the climax of his
life. "Here, try this, I guess you can make it
stick on," he said. The brown derby fell among
the ferns, and trembling hands seized the shining
beaver. "<i>Auwe, auwe! heaha keia! ka nani!
ka maikai! Auwe! ka lokomaikai!</i>"<a name="ft5" id="ft5"></a><a href="#f5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Over the
shining bald head it was pressed, coaxed, urged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_17" id="page_17">[17]</a></span>
and settled, and <i>it was a tight fit</i>. "There," said
Mr. Hamilton, "I told you so, he would wear that
hat if it killed him, rather than not take it when
he had the chance! Of course he never had a silk
hat before in his life."</p>

<p class="note"><a name="f5" id="f5"></a><a href="#ft5">[5]</a>: "Oh my! oh my! what's this! how splendid, how fine! Ah, what generosity!"</p>

<p>The old man was speechless and voluble by
turns. His good fortune choked him, but the
joys of possession ran over his eyes and sparkled
in every square inch of his honest face. Ruth
brought some wrapping paper, and Mrs. Hamilton
helped fold the articles for easy carrying. "But
my hat, how am I going to carry my hat?" he
wailed. "I'll wear this one," putting the derby on
his head, "but this <i>papale kilika</i> (silk hat) is to
wear to church, and how am I to carry it home?"
Another paper was brought, and, with twine, a secure
package was made, with a loop to slip over
his arm. Then a fresh idea came to the old man.
Conscious of the humor of the whole situation, he
said, "You have left me only one thing to ask for,"
and he raised a foot to which was bound a much
worn shoe. "Shoes!" cried Ruth, "May I find
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_18" id="page_18">[18]</a></span>
some, Mamma?" and in less time than it takes to
tell it she was back with a pair of half-worn brogans
that were more beautiful in Kalani's eyes
than the handsomest ten-dollar boots that ever
came out of a shoe emporium. Now there really
seemed to be nothing left but for the old man to
go, but he had something to say.</p>

<p>Lifting his happy face, he said, "You have been
very good to me. I have no money to buy such
things for myself, and I was going to ask only for
a coat. I live in Palolo valley, and have no means
of earning anything. I brought a few eggs with
me, thinking I could change them for something
to take back to my old wife, but now I would like
to give them to you." He slipped the cover from
his pail and held up to Mrs. Hamilton's view the
half dozen small eggs. Tears filled her eyes at his
honest, dignified independence. "No, no," said
she, slipping a coin in among the eggs, "get
something for the wife with the eggs, and give
her our <i>aloha</i>."</p>

<p>At last with many an <i>aloha</i> and <i>auwe</i> of benediction,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_19" id="page_19">[19]</a></span>
Kalani betook himself and his new wealth
down the drive, and the Hamilton family
answered the breakfast bell.</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_20" id="page_20">[20]</a></span>

<h3><a name="chapterIII" id="chapterIII"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span></h3>

<p>The barking of a small dog awoke Nalima
from a nap. Sitting up, she saw at a little distance
down the valley, someone coming up the
path. At first she thought it was Kalani, then
saw that it was a <i>haole</i> hat that appeared and disappeared
among the bushes. "<i>Auwe</i>, it's some
trespasser that's come up here because Kalani is
away, what shall I do?" While she yet feared,
the figure stood at the door and Kalani's voice reassured
her.</p>

<p>We may not repeat all that Nalima listened to,
for in another tongue than the Hawaiian, its flavor
would be much impaired. The simple souls accepted
the great good fortune of the suit of
clothes, the shoes, and the hats, with childlike
simplicity. The long and early walk had given
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_21" id="page_21">[21]</a></span>
Kalani a hearty appetite, which the sour poi,
spiced with a bit of salt salmon from the <i>Pake</i>
(Chinese) store at Moiliili, soon appeased. Nalima
produced a few mountain apples she had
gathered during his absence, and they felt they
had feasted like chiefs of old.</p>

<p>Nor can we tell of the profound sensation produced
in the little district church the following
Sabbath, when Kalani entered dressed in his new
suit, and crowned with his silk hat. This latter
he wore until he took his seat, so that all might see
it; then he carefully placed it on the bench beside
him. It seemed as if the possession of this silk hat
bade fair to restore to him his prestige of the long
ago. That he should have been in such high favor
with anyone, as to receive such a gift, surely
argued greatly for his birthright, and for the
heritage of his youth, of which the younger generation
had not been aware. Certain it was that
soon after this Kalani was made a deacon in the
church, and other honors were accorded him in
the months that followed. In the little hut in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_22" id="page_22">[22]</a></span>
valley, the driest corner was given to the precious
hat, and Nalima gently fondled it as she smoothed
it again and again, hoping to preserve its shining
gloss indefinitely. It was not pride but <i>satisfaction</i>
in this <i>special possession</i> that filled Kalani's
soul. He often removed the paper in which it was
kept, and, holding it upon his hand, would relate
to Nalima the experiences of that momentous
morning walk, when he became possessed of this
treasure. And Nalima never tired of listening to
the tale, though she had long known it by heart.
In closing he always said, "The best of it all was,
I know they were <i>glad</i> to give it to me, and, Nalima,
you know what to do with it if I die first."</p>

<p>"Mamma," cried Ruth Hamilton, reining her
horse beside her mother's porch one afternoon a
year later, "George and I have been for a ride
out to Wailupe and back, and as we came near
the Palolo Valley road on our way home, we saw
a funeral procession coming down. It passed the
corner just as we reached it, and, what do you
think! On the <i>top of the coffin was a silk hat</i>,
and George declares it's the same one Papa gave
that old man that came here one morning a good
while ago!"</p>

<p>Even so, according to the customs which still
obtain in many lands, and which have been
handed down through the centuries, of burying
one's choicest possessions with the body of the
deceased, Kalani and his silk hat were not parted
in the grave.</p>

e stood shivering on the brink. At
our very feet was the crater of
Haleakala, the House of the sun,
but that luminary had gone to his
other realms and left his dwelling
dark, unfathomable and
void. No voice of nature was there, no murmuring
breeze, no note of bird, no spirit of man
or of God moved in those lone and abysmal
depths. Only the brilliant stars kept watch
above, and they were immeasurable miles away.</p>

<p>We, who stood there in the cool morning air
did not add in any way to the majesty of the
scene, wrapped as we were in blankets&mdash;red,
white and gray.</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_25" id="page_25">[25]</a></span>

<p>"Like lost spirits waiting for waftage to the
other shore," remarked the tourist.</p>

<p>"I am sure I have lost my spirits," said a shivering
unfortunate, "I think the guide stole them."</p>

<p>"It seems to me we look more like a group of
savage Apaches on a bleak mountain summit
sketched by Remington," suggested the artist of
the crowd.</p>

<p>"Ah, there she blows," cried the first speaker
pointing toward the east where a shaft of light
had just shot from the dark sea through the gray
clouds. We all turned and looked except the
newly married couple. They gazed into each
others eyes as was their custom.</p>

<p>"I am so cold, dearest," she murmured.</p>

<p>I supposed he furnished her with a share of his
red blanket though I was not watching.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," said the humorist,
"the grand cyclorama of sunrise on Haleakala is
about to open, and as a preliminary, I move to
throw the poet over the brink as a propitiatory
sacrifice to the God of the Sun, who appears to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_26" id="page_26">[26]</a></span>
be shocked by our appearance; and besides the
poet will attempt to describe this scene and he
can't."</p>

<p>"Describe nothing," retorted the poet, "my
teeth are chattering so my tongue can't." "Let's
throw the guide over, that will propitiate us anyway."</p>

<p>But William, the guide, looked so calm and
peaceful as he sat with his back against a rock
smoking a short black pipe, that we decided not
to disturb him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sun rose. He has done this so
often that it has become a matter of course with
him. But rarely has he risen surrounded with
such pomp of circumstance and kingly glory. It
might well have been his coronation morning,
with clouds of heavy gorgeousness upon his shining
shoulders, and the quick heralds of light sent
to glorify the distant mountain heights and to
awaken the dark and slumbering sea. We seemed
to be moving in worlds unrealized as the light
swept across the reach of clouds at our feet,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_27" id="page_27">[27]</a></span>
broken as a sea of tumbled ice, while around the
outer rim rose forms strange or fantastic, the
clouds shaping themselves into huge animals or
rounding into noble palaces or turning into lofty
pinnacles, and on every one the sun had set a
crown of flame. The light with glowing hands
pulled slowly back the shadows from the crater
until it stood clearly revealed in its silence and
vastness. From West Maui to Molokai stretched
a heavy causeway of cloud beneath which lay
the sea dark and glowing like polished porphyry.
The sun was above the cloud and the common
light of day lay round us.</p>

<p>"Tis past, the visionary splendor fades," remarked
the poet, but the remark was not original
with him.</p>

<p>Our party now adjourned to the stone house
on the summit known as Cruyealece and after
drinking some hot coffee and warming ourselves
around the open fire, the humorist and myself
testified to our intention of taking William and
walking down into the crater. They all said that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_28" id="page_28">[28]</a></span>
we were decided idiots, and they would take their
exercise out in watching us. The newly married
couple said nothing, but looked as I have stated.</p>

<p>"I think that haole can't go down," remarked
William, pointing to the humorist. "His legs too
thin, they break."</p>

<p>We all laughed except the humorist who could
not see the joke.</p>

<p>"Break! you fat rascal," he exclaimed, "before
I am done with you, you won't be anything but
an animated brown shadow."</p>

<p>With sarcastic comments which did not disturb
our serenity and much waving of handkerchiefs
we began the descent. We went down at a very
rapid gait, the loose dirt smoking at our heels
and the canteen thumping against William's fat
sides. In a half hour we reached the floor of the
crater and stopped to take breath. After William
had lighted his pipe we went on our way. First
across the black lava flows and broken aa. In
the days of its storm and stress this had been the
hot and glowing life-blood of the great volcano,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_29" id="page_29">[29]</a></span>
but now it was cold, black and congealed. Beyond
the flows we came to long stretches of volcanic
sands and the lofty cones rose above us, so
perfect in form that it seemed the slightest breath
of air would disturb their symmetry. Their coloring
was wonderful, velvety black, gray and red
shading into one another. And through the vast
silence the silvery notes of a bird floated down to
us from the far battlements of the crater.</p>

<p>After a toilsome tramp we reached the other
side where the trees come down the slope, and
throwing ourselves down in the shade we looked
across the burning plain and enjoyed the coolness
by way of contrast as we smoked and took
chance shots at stray goats coming down the
ridge.</p>

<p>"Do you know any stories or legends connected
with Haleakala, William?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know one, my grandma always telling."</p>

<p>"That's right, William," said the humorist,
"take down your harp from the weeping lauhala
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_30" id="page_30">[30]</a></span>
trees, and sing to us of the departed glories of
your race."</p>

<p>"You see my grandma great old woman, she
kahuna, live at Hana. I hear this story every
since I was keiki. She says it comes down from
some old poets."</p>

<p>And after gazing across the crater for a while
William began in his native tongue:</p>

<p>"In former times from the distant Islands of
the southern sea came a strange people to Hawaii.
On their spears were the great sharks'
teeth, and their tabu staffs were crowned with
kapa black or white. They were great of <ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'statue'">stature</ins>
and became the mois of Hawaii. Then followed
a people from beyond the rising sun. Small and
broad they were, and came in ships such as were
never before seen in Hawaiian seas. But stranger
than these peoples was an alien race which came
from out the distant north from whence the great
trees come floating down upon the rivers of the
sea, and the tradewinds take their rise, which
come to cool our valleys and the burning sea.</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_31" id="page_31">[31]</a></span>

<p>It was in the days when Hua, the impious king
reigned in Hana, on the third day before the feast
of Lono in the early morning when the fishermen
were returning, six canoes came from out a mist
that floated on the sea, and moved quickly in
even line toward the curving beach. The night
before the omens had portended some dire event.
The sacrifices had risen from the blood stained
lele and stalked beyond the heiau gate, while,
from the heights of Haleakala, issued the groanings
of the Thunder God. As the aliens strode
upon the beach they were taller than our tallest
chiefs. Their skins were red as Pele blood that
beats within our heart, but their eyes were black
as is that blood when it cools upon the mountain
sides, yet from them shot fire as the lightning
from the thunder clouds. Their heads were encircled
by high feather leis which swept backwards
almost to the ground. Feathers were they
grey and white such as never grew upon the birds
that fly within the forests or float upon the sea.</p>

<p>The King took the strangers to his royal hale
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_32" id="page_32">[32]</a></span>
and gave them food and drink. There was a
woman with them, the wife of their great chief.
She appeared like a prophetess, only young. Her
skin was pale as the white sea foam. Her dark
eyes seemed to gaze afar off, and her smile was
like the flash of sun upon the sea. When Hua
saw her he desired her for himself and his women
became as nothing in his eyes. Therefore Hua
urged the redmen to make their home near his
hale and they should be aliis in the land though
the priest Luahomoe, warned the king that their
coming would cast a shadow on his life. But the
strangers would not dwell with the king nor with
his people, but made their home far up on the
slope of Haleakala where the gray clouds ever
hang and the white rain falls silently to the
ground.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the feather hunters sought
the mamo and the oo upon the mountains they
would see a figure of one of these men standing
on the highest mountain peak against the black
clouds as though carved of stone, then, suddenly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_33" id="page_33">[33]</a></span>
he would raise his arms towards the sky and a cry
would come quick as a javlin piercing to the
heart, or, they would hear a rustling in the ferns
and see a shape like a red moo moving through
the green, but whence it came or whither it went
they could never tell.</p>

<p>It chanced that on a certain day their great
chief came down to the plain and went to see the
king who was stretched at ease in front of his hale
on a kapa mat, while the trade winds waved the
falling branches of the kou trees like green kahilis
above his kingly head. The great chief stood and
would not sit upon the matting brought by the
attendant. Then the king made a sign to one of
his retainers who in a short time, brought several
maidens with flowers decking their dark hair, and
ornaments of pearl and shells upon their ankles
and their arms. They were the fairest in Hua's
court. The King <ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'waived'">waved</ins> his hand toward where
they stood and said:</p>

<p>"Take these, O chief, they are yours, but let
the white queen dwell with me."</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_34" id="page_34">[34]</a></span>

<p>Then the great chief folded his arms and looked
down at the king while Hua's guard gathered
close around him, for there was evil in the great
chief's eye, and the king was a very little man before
him. Then he grunted 'Umph' and turning
left the presence of the king and went quickly to
his mountain home.</p>

<p>But Hua's heart was hot within his breast, so
he vowed to take the great chief's life and bring
the white queen to his royal hale. Forthwith he
sent his lunapais into every valley and along the
sea to summon the alii and their warriors, but a
messenger came the following day from the great
chief saying:</p>

<p>"I know your plotting and your heart O King.
We will make an end of this matter. Place your
kingdom against the possession of the white
queen. Choose your <ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'mightest'">mightiest</ins> warrior, and I will
meet him. If I die, take the white queen, but if
your warrior dies your people and your lands are
mine, O King. But this one condition, I will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_35" id="page_35">[35]</a></span>
choose the place where this combat is to be
fought."</p>

<p>The crafty Hua thought within his heart, "I
will accept this challenge, and if my champion
fall my warriors will surround him and his men
and slay them. Then the white queen shall not
escape me." So he assented. The messenger then
took the king and, pointing where the clouds
were flowing through the Kaupo gap, he said:
"In yonder hollow mountain fights the chief."</p>

<p>The king's heart was troubled then, but he dare
not return upon his spoken word. Among the
alii there was none so tall and powerful as the
young Kuala. In all the sports of peace he was
pre-eminent. While in war none would hurl the
spear so swiftly, nor use the javlin with such
skilled hands, and when he whirled the battle axe
above his head none could see it for the speed.
He was chosen champion by the King.</p>

<p>For many days the priests consulted the oracles
within the enclosure of the sacred anu, but the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_36" id="page_36">[36]</a></span>
omens puzzled <ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'then'">them</ins>, and they said the Gods were
not at peace among themselves.</p>

<p>It was on the evening before the day just as the
sun sank into the sea, there came a cloud, blacker
than the kapa for the dead, moving slowly above
the sea, and the gray rain following as a veil behind
it. The air around was very still. Then,
suddenly the cloud turned to crimson and the
mountain and the thousands on the beach were
reddened as though by the glow from a great fire.
All were frightened, but Kuala only laughed and
said, "If it storms now it will be cooler on the
morrow." The old priest shook his head and
said, "My son, that mountain height will be plenty
cool enough for thee."</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of the destined day the
hosts of Maui were gathered in the arms of the
great mountain. Foremost stood the King.
Around his shoulders fell the yellow mamo cloak,
and on his head a helmet yellow as his robe save
its crest which was red with the feathers of the
scarlet bird. Behind him stood the priests in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_37" id="page_37">[37]</a></span>
feather cloaks red as the blood of their sacrifices,
while in a half circle rose the hundred alii in
cloaks mingled with the royal yellow and the
priestly red. As the sunlight shone upon them
they were in form and color as the rainbows bent
over the valleys green, and on the rounded hills
of sand above them stood the warriors thicker
than the leaves upon the forest trees, and their
thousand spears made the red hills black. A murmur
ran amongst them as when the voice of the
sea comes on the south wind and the sky is gray.
The priests chanted in low tones, the meles of
Kuala's race, and waved their arms as they sang
of heroic deeds. Kuala stood quietly by the king
and looked across the lava plain where, in the distance,
could be seen the red men moving, one
behind the other, in a line. They came swiftly.
When they reached a hundred paces from where
stood the king, they stopped and the white queen
stood forth before them. Her color was no longer
as the pale foam, for the blood beat quickly in
her cheeks, and she breathed as though she had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_38" id="page_38">[38]</a></span>
been running, while her eyes shone so that even
Hua turned his glance away. The great chief
stood near her but impassive as though carved of
stone. Behind them the warriors stood lean and
red with strange colors on their faces, and their
heads were crowned with warlike feathers. They
moved not, nor looked upon the warriors on the
hills, regardless of them as though they were but
crawling ants. Then the messenger of the chief
advanced across the sand and stood before the
king.</p>

<p>"O King, the chief is ready now to offer the
victim chosen by you for the sacrifice."</p>

<p>Hua replied, "My champion is here at my
right hand, and to-night we will wrap your chief
in the funeral kapa, and the black sharks will dine
upon his flesh." He would have spoken more but
the messenger turned upon his heel and left the
king.</p>

<p>Kuala threw aside his feathered cloak and advanced
slowly towards the level sand. Then
there rose a shout from the hosts upon the hill
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_39" id="page_39">[39]</a></span>
louder than the thunder of the great waves falling
on the beach, and the priests chanted in loud
tones beating wildly on their sacred drums. The
great chief advanced to meet his foe but stopped,
and with arms outstretched towards the sun
gazed straight into its burning light while his
voice reached to the remotest warrior on the hills,
though none could understand the words, so
strange they were. Then he turned and faced
Kuala, who stood twenty paces distant. All was
quiet as is the air before a coming storm. Kuala
slowly raised his spear above his head and bending
quickly forward sent it with such force that
none could see it in the air, but the great chief
was quicker than the spear and it went past him
deep into the sand. His spear flew so close to
Kuala that he felt the wind of its speed upon his
cheek. The second time they raised their arms
together and send the weapons whirling through
the air. The warrior's spear struck some feathers
from the great chief's head, whose weapon went
straight to Kuala's heart, but before it touched
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_40" id="page_40">[40]</a></span>
his body Kuala caught it with his hands and turned
its course aside, but staggered backwards with
the force. Then the warriors cried in lamentation
on the hills, but when they saw he was unhurt
a shout arose louder than the first. The last
spear Kuala poised above his head was of polished
koa tipped with ivory, whose point had been
dipped in Po's dark waters, carrying death upon
its slightest touch. But it never reached the red
chief's for the two spears met in the air with a
great clash and fell broken on the sand. Then
the warriors rushed towards each other and met
midway on the sands, their javelins clashing as
they met. Suddenly the light had faded while
gray clouds covered the crater as with a roof, and
the white rain began to fall thick and fast, lying
like white stars on cloaks of the alii and of king.
Kuala and the great chief could be dimly seen as
they whirled around each other in the strife faster
than sea birds on the wing. Now rushing together,
now stepping quick aside, but Kuala's
breathing could be heard by the king and his alii
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_41" id="page_41">[41]</a></span>
standing near; while the great chief moved quicker
than the red lightning from the clouds, without
a sound save when his javelin struck the warriors.
But moving backward from Kuala's rush his heel
struck upon a stone and he swayed slightly. Then
the warrior's javelin tore his shoulder till the red
blood came. With a cry that made the king and
all his followers shiver as with cold, he sprang
past Kuala's javelin and fastened his teeth within
the flesh and his face was like a demon as he tore
the warrior's throat, and Kuala fell slowly back
upon the sand, writhing in quick death. Then
the Hulumanu, standing by the King, threw his
spear and pierced the great chief who fell face
downward on the sand. From the hills the warriors
came with a mighty rush as slides the land
from the steep mountain sides, while the red men
awaited their coming with faces lean and fierce.
They stood as does a rock within the sea when
the great waves surge upon it fall back in beaten
foam until one mightier than the rest o'erwhelms
it. So stood, so fell the red men on that day.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_42" id="page_42">[42]</a></span>
Hua marked not the raging of the strife but
through the tumult pushed his way toward where
the white queen stood alone. She fled with exceeding
swiftness, moving like a shadow through
the falling mist. Hua, in furious anger, raised
his spear and sent it straight towards her as she
fled. Then the cloud grew thicker and closed
around them. Instantly a great cry was heard
and the King's people found him bleeding on the
sand with his spear point centering in his breast.
Whither the white queen went none ever knew.
But sometimes the hunter, following his lonely
trail through the great mountain, sees a woman's
form wrapped in moving mist and with dark hair
floating wildly around the pallor of her face."</p>

<p>"That's all," said the guide.</p>

<p>"That's quite a little lie, William," said the
humorist.</p>

<p>"I don't know, the old lady says it is just so."</p>

<p>As we started on our homeward trail the clouds
had rolled through the two gaps and an opaque
mist lay around us. William headed the procession
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_43" id="page_43">[43]</a></span>
and we had gone about a quarter of a mile
and were near the great cone when William stopped
suddenly and grasped the humorist by the
arm, almost white with terror.</p>

<p>"Look!" he said, pointing towards where the
fog had lifted somewhat, and a current of air was
whirling the mist, and, in the mist a woman's
form and face could be clearly seen. I looked inquiringly
at the humorist.</p>

<p>"Can such things be," he said, "and overcome
us like a summer cloud, without our special
wonders?"</p>

<p>"There are more things in heaven and earth,
Horatio," I suggested.</p>

<p>Then we went on in silence through the falling
mist, but the humorist took the lead.</p>

r. Dole and I were standing in
front of one of the caves which are
found near the edges of the bay of
Hanauma which is situated this
side of Koko Head. We were
there for several days of recreation. Mr. Dole
was glad to get away from the Executive building,
where his Ministers had caged various bees in
their bonnets. These bees often wrangled with
the bees in his own bonnet, and by temporarily
separating them, the different bees ameliorated
their buzzing, and a general rest prevailed. Mr.
Dole said he preferred to take recreation with one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_45" id="page_45">[45]</a></span>
who had outgrown the bee-hive age and the age
of other annoying human devices.</p>

<p>"Do you see that flat stone?" I asked, pointing
to one that lay under some lantana bushes, and
was partially concealed by the sand and just beyond
the reach of the surf.</p>

<p>"I see it," said Mr. Dole. "Do you think that
some person with a bee in his bonnet has been
around? Has the stone a story?"</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "that stone belonged to the
foundation of a house which Peleg Chapman built
away back in the 'thirties.'"</p>

<p>"Tell me the story," said Mr. Dole and he sat
down on the grass, as if it were his Cabinet, and
stretched his legs out towards the much sounding
sea.</p>

<p>I then told him the story as I had obtained it
from the most authentic sources, included in
which were some scraps in Peleg Chapman's
handwriting.</p>

<p>Peleg's father, Silas Chapman, was a poor but
honest farmer who lived in Stockbridge, Massachusetts,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_46" id="page_46">[46]</a></span>
near the State line. He had been eminently
successful in achieving poverty, which he
shared generously with his wife and sons.
Though mentally dull in most matters, he possessed
a rare gift for training animals of all kinds.
He was a master of those inarticulate sounds,
and musical notes which curiously convey ideas
to animals. He talked with his dogs and cats,
and made them useful. His trained squirrels
brought him abundance of nuts, and his trained
robins brought him cherries without injuring
them. His cows, pigs, and chickens did curious
tricks, and when gathered together in the barnyard,
under his voice and eye, were more orderly
than the General Assembly of the State. These
useful animals did much to relieve the family
poverty. The collie dogs stole watermelons and
rolled them home, and the tame crows supplied
the cattle with ripe corn from the neighbors'
fields.</p>

<p>Peleg inherited from his father this singular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_47" id="page_47">[47]</a></span>
gift of training animals, and he had listened to
his luminous expositions of the subject.</p>

<p>"Peleg," he said, "all an'mals think. Ef you
only larn how they think, you ken do anything
with 'em. Each on 'em has a little different way
of working his gumption, but you kinder sit along
side 'on 'em, get to communin' with 'em in a slow
fashion, and you'l find 'em ekal to human critters."</p>

<p>Peleg in due time became more skillful than his
father, in training animals. He caught a young
eagle over in Lenox, and trained him to relieve
the family poverty by stealing chickens over in
York State. The eagle was not morally very
strong, and often brought home the tough
roosters, after eating the tender chickens.</p>

<p>One day, when Peleg was away, the eagle being
in a contrary mood, seized Silas Chapman's Sunday
coat, and flying away with it dropped it into
the Housatonic river. When Peleg reached home,
his father told him that the eagle had done a mean
job, and that he must pay for the stolen coat.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_48" id="page_48">[48]</a></span>
Peleg refused on the ground that animals had no
morals.</p>

<p>"Dad," he said, "you be livin' off them thievin'
dogs and birds." Then said his father: "I guess
Peleg you and me has got to have some interestin'
conversation in the barn, this evenin'."</p>

<p>Peleg acted promptly on this suggestion. At
four o'clock, with a small sum of money, he
secretly went to the station, and boarded the Boston
express. He left a note to his mother saying
he was going off and his dad might lick the eagle
if he caught him.</p>

<p>On reaching Boston, he wandered about until
he reached the Frog pond in the Common. He
had often heard that its waters were sacred in
the eyes of every Bostonian. Feeling much depressed
he took out of his pocket a copy of the
<ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'Wesminster'">Westminster</ins> Catechism, which every child studied
in those days, and by accident glanced over the
rough wood cuts of Biblical incidents. His eye
fell on that of a very stiff looking whale, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_49" id="page_49">[49]</a></span>
very stiff looking Jonah in front of it, waiting
with a very resigned look to be swallowed.</p>

<p>While he was getting some comfort out of
Jonah's resigned look, a sea-faring man took a
seat by his side, on the public bench, and after
glancing at the picture in Peleg's hand, remarked:
"purty stiff lookin' whale I guess."</p>

<p>"Ever see'd one?" asked Peleg.</p>

<p>"Caught plenty on 'em," said the sailor. "Been
around the Horn and up in the Artic for sperm
and right whales. Plenty of lay money too.
Down in Wyhee plenty of gals and bananas."</p>

<p>"Goin' again?" asked Peleg.</p>

<p>"Yes, next week," said the sailor.</p>

<p>"Take me?" asked Peleg.</p>

<p>"Guess you can ship on the Julian," said the
sailor. "Fresh fo'cas'le hand gets one hundred
and fortieth lay. That's his share of all the oil
and bone the vessel takes in her cruise. Have
good luck, plenty of money," said the sailor.</p>

<p>Peleg glanced at the stiff figure of the whale,
closed the book, and said, "I'm goin'."</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_50" id="page_50">[50]</a></span>

<p>On reaching New Bedford, he shipped on the
Julian, signed ship's articles, and went on board
with a new kit. The vessel sailed for the Pacific
and the Arctic ocean.</p>

<p>For a few days, Peleg would have been willing
to return home and take the vicarious punishment
for the eagle's sins rather than sleep in a fo'cas'le
bunk. But the ship bowled along towards the
equator, and the carefully expurgated yarns of
the crew kindled his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>He caught and trained some sea gulls to fetch
fish for the cabin and for'rad deck so that his
shipmates, instead of calling him a blankety land
lubber, took pains to teach him the art of handling
ropes, and chewing old plug tobacco, and reading
the sulphurous marine literature of the age.</p>

<p>The Julian took five hundred barrels of sperm
oil off the island of Juan Fernandez, and finally
dropped her anchor in the harbor of Honolulu,
for the purpose of getting wood and water and
fresh provisions.</p>

<p>On going ashore, Peleg was amazed at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_51" id="page_51">[51]</a></span>
abundance of bananas of which he was very fond,
but for which the price at home was one shilling
each. As he gorged himself, he began to think
of exchanging his marine interest in the Pacific
for a residence on the Islands. He felt justified
in deserting, because the air of the forecastle was
bad, and the captain had refused to reconstruct
the vessel and place saloon cabins at the disposal
of the crew. He obtained from Mellish &amp; Co.,
ship chandlers, an advance of $300 on his lay,
and deserted. He concealed himself at Waimanalo,
until the vessel sailed for the Arctic, and
then keeping out of the way of the native police
or "kikos," he crossed over into Manoa valley and
followed the coast line from Waikiki towards
Koko Head. Finding the secluded bay of Hanauma
he remained there. It was surrounded by
a high ridge, as it was part of an extinct crater,
and one side of it had fallen in towards the ocean,
so that it was almost land locked, and the surf
and heavy seas rushed through the narrow
opening.</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_52" id="page_52">[52]</a></span>

<p>With the aid of a native, he laid a foundation
of flat stones and built upon them a thatched
house. The native brought him fruit and vegetables,
and he caught an abundance of fish.</p>

<p>While the Julian was off the island of Juan Fernandez,
Peleg had studied the numerous sharks
found there. He discovered that the many rows
of teeth in the mouth of the female shark were
flexible, and rested on elastic gums. They could
be laid flat, at the will of the shark. The reason
for this curious arrangement was this. Whenever
the young sharks are in danger, the mother
shark opens her mouth, lays down her teeth, and
the young sharks pass over without danger, into
a pouch in her body where they remain until the
danger is over. He had counted as many as
seventy, each of them about three feet long, at
one time diving into their mother's mouth, and
emerging after the danger was over. He remembered
that Prof. Aggasiz or some noted naturalist,
had suggested that in some remote period a
female kangaroo had tumbled overboard from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_53" id="page_53">[53]</a></span>
some prehistoric canoe, and, according to Mr.
Darwin, had adapted itself to the new environment,
and become a shark. The pouch for the
young which appears on the outside in the case
of the kangaroo, appears as a pouch on the inside
of the shark.</p>

<p>Peleg learned from the natives that at times fish
were very scare in the Honolulu market. During
the visits of the whaling fleets which often numbered
over a hundred vessels, the demand could
not be supplied with any regularity. When there
was bad weather, the canoes could not put out to
sea, and there was a fish famine excepting so far
as it could be supplied from the local fish ponds
that were entirely owned by the chiefs and King.</p>

<p>Besides there were some rare fish which the
chiefs were especially fond of which were found
only in deep water and could only be obtained
under the most favorable circumstances of tide
and weather. Such were the Kawele-a, the Ahi,
the Ono and the Omaka. The Ahi was a very
delicate fish and was found only off the coast of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_54" id="page_54">[54]</a></span>
Hawaii, and was seldom seen in Honolulu
markets.</p>

<p>Peleg said to himself: "Why not train sharks
to catch fish? It may be as dad said, some bother
to find out their way of thinkin' and they live in
the water. But they has eyes and ears, and they
hasn't got them things for nothing."</p>

<p>He caught, with the aid of some natives, an
immense female shark, and before the young ones
could hide, he captured them all, and put them
in a pond he built up in the water. He began to
educate them. At first they were quite vicious,
and refused to be cheerful. But Peleg knew that
from the crab to the seraphim, the appeal to the
appetite was most effective. After repeated experiments,
he found that sharks had a most extraordinary
fondness for salt pork. There was a
monotony of freshness in their ordinary diet, excepting
as a sailor with a rich tobacco flavor, fell
in their way once in a while. He also discovered
that the addition of beans to the pork made the
food especially attractive, and the young sharks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_55" id="page_55">[55]</a></span>
quickly submitted to discipline with this reward
before them.</p>

<p>He saw that they thought in their crude way,
just as dogs and birds thought, and their hearing
was like that of other animals. By tapping stones
under water he could call them, but he generally
used a speaking tube which he thrust into the
water. By using rags of different colors, he
trained them to distinguish between colors. He
taught them to fetch and carry sticks, and then
pieces of meat. As they grew older, he trained
them to search for fish in the bay, and to bring
them in without injuring them as they took them
in or cast them out of their pouches. Pork and
beans were liberally used as rewards. He was
finally successful in teaching them to distinguish
between the grades of fish and as it were, take
orders for special kinds and leave the rest. The
most intelligent learned to travel long distances,
even to Maui and Hawaii, and find the feeding
grounds of the rare fish of which he kept samples
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_56" id="page_56">[56]</a></span>
in a pond, and exhibited to them whenever he
desired a supply of that variety.</p>

<p>He never permitted the natives to watch him
while in his training school. He gave names to
the expert and reliable sharks. His reading was
limited so that he selected names from the Bible
and from the names of the towns near his home.
He called them "Lenox belle," "Barrington belle,"
"Pittsfield belle," "Lee belle," "Bashbish belle,"
"Stockbridge belle," and many other Berkshire
names were used. The Scriptural names were
"Queen of Sheba," "Jezabel," "Mehita-bel" and
"Assyrian girl," with other such names. The
word "belle" appealed to his poetic instinct.</p>

<p>He graduated the sharks after two years of
training, and then opened business. He purchased
a canoe, and paddled out to sea, followed
by more than twenty submissive fish. He sent
them off singly or by battalion, as he called it.
In the battalion form, they moved out on an extended
line and drove the fish desired towards
the caves and small inlets, where they were easily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_57" id="page_57">[57]</a></span>
caught, taken into the pouches, and brought to
Peleg's canoe, and pork and beans were liberally
served out in return.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the next whaling fleet, Peleg
entered Honolulu harbor every morning with a
large load of mullet in his canoe or with other
excellent fish. After disposing of them to the
whalers, he put out of the harbor at once, and
joined his "sea hounds" as he called them, who
waited for him outside the reef. His enormous
catches attracted the attention of the natives, who
once followed him in the hope of finding his rich
fishing grounds. They were especially surprised
at his large catch during stormy weather, when
they could not go out in their canoes. Nor, by
watching Hanauma bay could they get any information,
as there were no nets there, and the
sharks attracted no attention.</p>

<p>On one occasion as he was paddling along the
Waikiki shore after selling his load of fish, he
met a fleet of native canoes that had no luck.
Taking compassion on them, he dipped his tube
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_58" id="page_58">[58]</a></span>
under water, gave the sign for mullet to his sea
dogs, shipped his paddle, and lit his pipe. In an
hour the noses of his hunters rubbed against the
side of the canoe, and leaning over, he pulled out
of their mouths more than six hundred pounds
of mullet, and threw them into the canoes of the
natives. The natives were stricken with terror at
the sight, and dropped their paddles with the exclamation:
"He is a kahuna (sorcerer) of the
shark god."</p>

<p>He was soon regarded as an akua (god). No
natives dared to enter the bay of Hanauma.</p>

<p>At the end of each whaling season he accumulated
considerable sums in gold, a part of which
he hid and a part he invested in the purchase of
shares in whalers. After the season, he engaged
in fishing for the rare fish only, which he supplied
to the King and chiefs. Whenever the King
said: "Peleg, my friend, I want some of the
Ahi," Peleg sent four of his leading sharks to
the Kona coast, and they returned within ten
hours, with an abundance.</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_59" id="page_59">[59]</a></span>

<p>The King sent for him one day and said to
him: "You are the most valuable man in my
kingdom, and as my predecessors rewarded Isaac
Davis and John Young with matrimonial alliances,
I would be glad to have you look around
and if you see any attractive female of the royal
connection that you would like to marry, you
may take her until otherwise ordered. I wish for
useful men about my throne. I put on no airs,
excepting a white cotton shirt. If you accept my
offer you are authorized to wear an Admiral's
cocked hat, and new boots on State occasion."
Peleg replied that he recognized the honor, but
that his heart belonged to his sharks and to the
daughter of a carpenter who lived near the York
State line, and he expected to visit her very soon.</p>

<p>A fanatical native attempted to "anaana" him
or pray him to death. He gathered grass and
burned it. The oily kukui nuts were thrown on
the fire, and the whole resources of the Polynesian
Black Art were brought into use. But Peleg
lived.</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_60" id="page_60">[60]</a></span>

<p>A missionary, hearing of his remarkable
powers, visited him and inquired about his ancestors,
and among other questions asked him if he
had become a heathen and allowed himself to become
a kahuna or sorcerer. He replied that he
did not hanker after heathenism, but, he said, that
if he was in the missionary business he would
open a conjuring saloon and beat all their old
kahunas at sleight of hand tricks, and that would
soon bring the whole crowd over to his side. The
heathen, he said, couldn't do much thinking but
if they saw him pull a rabbit out of his nose, or
take a taro out of a man's ear, they would smash
the business of their own conjuring priests.
Seein' was believin'. Conjuring tricks would
finally bust up their superstitions. The missionary
said he and his associates could not look
upon the matter in that way, but he would write
to the American Board about it, and ask it to send
out a respectable conjurer of high moral principle
who would hitch a moral to the tail end of every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_61" id="page_61">[61]</a></span>
trick, and then challenge a native sorcerer to do
any better.</p>

<p>Peleg said that although he was a perverted
Puritan, he would supply all of the Honolulu missionaries
with fish without charge.</p>

<p>As he had received a very limited education
owing to his father's flourishing poverty, he
seldom wrote any letters. He did not forget
his mother, however. She received from time
to time, through Bunker &amp; Co., of New Bedford,
comfortable sums of money, with the
statement that they came from her son, who
was somewhere on the equator, and would
come home after awhile. He also sent to
Patsy McGloural, who had grown up and did
the chores in the family of a rich paper manufacturer,
a sandal wood box, and a dress of the
finest Chinese silk, which he got from one of the
vessels in the sandal wood trade. This dress was
the finest in Berkshire county, and when Patsy
put it on and went to church, it attracted the
attention of the women, so that the preacher gave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_62" id="page_62">[62]</a></span>
out the hymn about being "naked, poor and sinful."</p>

<p>Peleg had invested his money in shares in the
whaleships, which made very profitable voyages,
from Honolulu to the Arctic and Japan seas, and
he became rich for a Berkshire man. After ten
years of fishing he resolved to go home. He
found a young man who came from the neighboring
town of Hinsdale, on one of the new whalers,
and after giving him a long trial, instructed him
in the business. He consulted an attorney in Honolulu,
and executed an instrument establishing
the "Peleg Chapman Shark Trust," the income
of which was to be used in feeding his faithful
sharks with pork and beans, and in supplying the
poor natives of Honolulu with fish.</p>

<p>He then sailed for New Bedford, and on
arriving there, went directly home. He arrested
the even course of his father's poverty, but did
not inform his indigent but acute parent of the
sources of his fortune. He built for his mother
the finest chicken house in the county, and presented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_63" id="page_63">[63]</a></span>
her with a neat buggy and a gentle horse.
He soon married Patsy, and was known as Squire
Chapman. As a leading authority on travel, he
had no equal in those parts. Subsequently, with
the aid of a young student from Williams College,
he published in rather Sophomorical language, a
book which had a wide circulation titled, "Chapman's
researches in the islands of the Pacific."</p>

<h3>A Hawaiian Love Story.</h3>

<p><img class="figleft" src="images/letter_M.jpg" width="86" height="100" alt="M" title="M" /><br />
any years ago there lived in Hoikaopuiaawalau,
in Hamakua, on
Maui, a Hawaiian maiden whose
story I will tell as I heard it from
one who knew it too well.</p>

<p>"Her name, which they said was
given her by her <i>kupuna</i>, Hikiau, who was a
favorite chief under Kamehameha the great, was
Kalaninuiahilapalapa, but we always called her
Lani.</p>

<p>At the time we first met her she was about
eleven years of age, very pretty, with regular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_65" id="page_65">[65]</a></span>
features and long, black, silky hair. Like many
of the natives she had beautiful gazelle-eyes, such
as one never tires of gazing into. Probably those
eyes cost her most of her&mdash;well we will tell it.</p>

<p>She lived with her parents in that beautiful little
fern-clad valley, known today as Awalau,
where her father worked in a sawmill. He was
a very large and powerful man and as good
natured as large men usually are.</p>

<p>His name was Kapohakunuipalahalaha, but as
that was unnecessarily long, we shortened it to
Nui, and a faithful man Nui was at any kind of
work. Those who know what sawmill work is
know that great strength is appreciated, especially
when you are depending on a man to keep his
end of a cant-hook up to time. He was as hospitable
as the natives have the reputation of
being, and that is saying a good deal.</p>

<p>Lani's mother, Kamaka, was a sprightly woman
of about thirty-five and did her part to make "life
in the woods" pleasant. Neither mother nor
daughter appeared to have many household cares
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_66" id="page_66">[66]</a></span>
and seemed to take delight in wandering up and
down the valley in quest of land shrimps, which
they caught in a cornucopia-shaped basket made
of wicker work. These, with the little black fish
named oopu which they found adhering to the
stones in the brook, and a fern frond called pohole,
together with poi, the Hawaiian staff of life,
constituted the principal part of their diet. They
were also very fond of pig and chicken and never
begrudged the labor or time spent in getting up a
luau. From them we had an insight into the
Hawaiian mode of living and were surprised to
note to what an extent the natives are dependent
on the sea for a livelihood. Sometimes Nui would
take a day off, whether the master liked or not,
and take his family to the beach, when they employed
themselves in fishing. They would return
with the greatest assortment of shell-fish and fish
of many sizes of the most varied colors. Also
they would bring limu of several kinds and odors.
Limu, you know, is seaweed, and there appear
to be as many varieties of it as there are of ferns
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_67" id="page_67">[67]</a></span>
on the land. There is also a variety of it found
in the streams adhering to the rocks on the bottom,
which we were always taught to beware of
at home, but which the natives eat with cooked
meats with great gusto.</p>

<p>They always kept a store of kukui nuts, which
they roasted; then breaking up the kernels fine
and mixed with salt, they ate it as a relish.</p>

<p>The women took delight in adorning themselves
with leis, made either of the maile, which
grew in profusion on the steep sides of the
ravines, or of the <i>palapalai</i>, a luxuriant fern
which clothes the valleys as with a garment.
Sometimes they would make leis of the fruit of
the hala tree, the <i>pandanus</i>, which was also very
plentiful in that part of the island. Sometimes
they would inter-twine the bright hala fruit and
the fragrant glossy leaves of the maile, which
made a very beautiful lei, especially on an olive
skin as a background.</p>

<p>Often we were called in to eat with them and
learned to like almost all their native dishes. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_68" id="page_68">[68]</a></span>
was always the custom to call in any stranger
passing, to share their food with them. Their
style of cooking, viz: under ground, or in a saucepan
over an open fire, seemed to give the food a
piquancy which had charms for us.</p>

<p>Lani had a very sweet voice and accompanied
her singing with a guitar, which she played very
sweetly and many an evening we passed about
the campfire very comfortably. She could yodel
like an inhabitant of the Swiss Alps and often we
would hear her singing and yodeling as she came
up the valley to cross up to the tableland where
we were cutting the large koa trees, preparatory
to hauling them to the mill to turn into the handsome
lumber so much sought after for making
fine furniture. There was not a man in the camp
who was not charmed with her.</p>

<p>There was a little Chinaman who came up
through our valley, leading pack horses, whose
business was buying <i>pepeiao</i>, an ear-shaped fungus
which is found very plentiful on the trunks
of decayed trees on the windward sides of all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_69" id="page_69">[69]</a></span>
islands. The natives gathered and dried these
and were always glad to see the Chinaman come
around, as they were enabled to exchange them
for either cash or the sweet cakes which he carried
in his panniers. This fungus contains a good
deal of gelatinous matter and was formerly largely
exported to China, where it is used for soup
making. This poor little waif of a Celestial,
named Leong Sing, fell in love with our Lani at
first sight and the frequent occasions he took for
wandering up our valley were not warranted by
the inextensive trade which he found. He made
the acquaintance of a Chinaman who had a camp
in a neighboring valley, where he was making
charcoal from the branches of the koa trees, which
he purchased from us. He got to staying over
night with his friend and would sometimes join
our campfire of an evening and listen to Lani's
singing. None of us suspected him of the effrontery
of falling in love with our Lani or of
expecting her to reciprocate his affection. While
at work one day in the woods her father told us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_70" id="page_70">[70]</a></span>
that the Chinaman had proposed and wanted to
carry her off to Lahaina, where his uncle had a
large store. This was a greater temptation to
Lani than we suspected, as she was very fond of
good clothes and the Chinese are noted for taking
the best of care of their wives in that respect.
Also was not Lahaina the capital, where young
people were numerous and where her accomplishments
would be appreciated?</p>

<p>Her father had higher aspirations for his
daughter and wished that she might marry a
haole.</p>

<p>There was a young man in camp, named
Frank Willoughby, (evidently a purser's name)
who had come round the Horn in a whaler and
had decamped as soon as the vessel touched at
Honolulu, as many of our best and worst men did.
Frank had a good education and was a very fine
looking, healthy young fellow of a most amiable
disposition. When Frank heard of the Chinaman's
proposal he said he would kill the saffron-colored
Celestial on sight and break every bone in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_71" id="page_71">[71]</a></span>
his body for his presumption. Then we knew
that Frank was badly smitten.</p>

<p>But he was not the only one who was struck
bad, as there was a young half Hawaiian-Portuguese
named Joe Edwards who was also very denunciatory
of the Chinaman and expressed a wish
for his speedy demise. Some of us had noticed
that Frank was jealous of Joe, as the latter could
play the ukeke or Hawaiian Jew's harp, very well,
and as a stranger cannot tell what the player is
singing on the instrument to his <i>dulcinea</i>, Frank
could not understand how far Joe had got along
in his courtship.</p>

<p>There was another party who was heels over
head in love with Lani and this was so utterly
unexpected that when the <i>denouement</i> took place,
"you might knock us all down with a feather."
This was a big hulk of a black Portuguese named
Shenandoah, from his having been captured on a
whaler by that Confederate pirate when on her
marauding excursion amongst the whalers in the
Arctic, from whence he was returned to Honolulu
with many others. He was a most repulsive,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_72" id="page_72">[72]</a></span>
villainous-looking scoundrel, with black warts on
his face; an Iago who could never capture our
Desdemona and consequently never came into our
calculations.</p>

<p>Anyway the Chinaman's name was "mud"
from that time on.</p>

<p>Frank could not talk much native and Lani's
English education had been sadly neglected, but
it would not be the first instance where love was
made with the eyes and not the tongue.</p>

<p>The work in the woods, felling those mammoth
koas and hauling them with cattle to the
mill, was looked on more as play than work, but
we were very tired at night just the same. The
<i>ieie</i>, an almost impenetrable climbing vine, seemed
to take delight in wrapping its rootlets around
those koas, to the vexation of the woodsman, and
it would sometimes take hours to get at the trunk
of a tree. In chopping this ieie the axe would
sometimes fly back to the peril of the chopper.
Once Frank had the bad or good luck to get cut
in the head with his axe and as he bled very freely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_73" id="page_73">[73]</a></span>
we were much alarmed and took him down to the
camp. Kamaka put a bandage of some native
herbs about his head and he remained at home for
two or three days. How far his courtship progressed
during his convalescence we were never
able to learn. Joe said he wished he himself could
get his foot cut off or something that he might be
invalided.</p>

<p>Sometime after this the boss told us we could
all go down to Wailuku for a holiday and spend
the Fourth of July, which was going to be grandly
celebrated that year on account of some favorable
news from home, provided we would take a
load of koa lumber down. Horses were not very
plentiful with us and we were to ride on the load.
As Nui and Shenandoah were to drive the six
yoke of oxen and Lani and her mother were to
ride we jumped at the opportunity.</p>

<p>The cattle were brought in from the woods,
after a tedious search for them, for a bullock can
hide himself easier under the <ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'parisitic'">parasitic</ins> vines and
<ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'convolvulous'">convolvulus</ins> which hang from those mammoth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_74" id="page_74">[74]</a></span>
koas than anywhere under the sun. The wagon
being loaded and the load bound on with chains
we eight took our places for an eighteen-mile
ride. Lani had provided leis for each of us and
she and her mother had collected an immensity of
ferns and ki leaves for a cushion to make the soft
side of the boards softer, and we had a large
hamper of lunch and a merrier party never started
for an ox-cart ride.</p>

<p>We got away about 5 a. m., Nui and Shenandoah
walking on either side of the team and there
never was more fun in a basket of monkeys than
on that wagon. He had our old standbys, Nigger
and Puakea on the tongue and the young cattle
ahead and the trouble these cattle caused, "I
couldn't be telling." They would dash ahead and
fetch up, then they would turn on their tracks
and get tangled in the chains, then after a lot of
bad language they would get straightened out
and make another break, and this was repeated
<i>ad nauseam</i>.</p>

<p>When we got them up out of the valley and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_75" id="page_75">[75]</a></span>
weight of the load was relieved they made a
break to run and almost pulled the heads off the
tongue cattle, who, I believe, would sooner have
lost those extremities than have been so undignified
as to go faster than a walk. Down we
went through Kawaiki, and through Huluhulunui,
Puaahookui, and Kaluanui gulches, the
young cattle on the tear and the old ones on their
haunches, notwithstanding the chain lock which
we had on the wheels. The only thing to hold on
to was the binding chain and after getting our
hands nipped a few times we preferred to maintain
our positions by leaning up against each
other. We could not refrain from remarking on
the solicitude which both Frank and Joe exhibited
for Lani's welfare, doing everything they could
devise for her comfort. We have helped tip over
a pair of bobs in the snow at home to hear the
girls squeal, but we never had an experience of
riding on a bullock cart with a trio of lovesick
people when every instant produced a bump
which would drive a sane person into insanity.</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_76" id="page_76">[76]</a></span>

<p>The sun came up right glorious and gave us
the benefit of its full actinic rays for the whole
day. However, had we been in a palace car we
could not have had more fun.</p>

<p>All across that sunburnt plain from East Maui
plantation to the beach at Kahului we bumped
over rocks and into gullies, for who ever knew
of a bullock team fool enough to miss any of those
opportunities of getting even on man for his
inhumanity to them. Towards 1 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> we reached
Kahului, the cattle with their tongues hanging
out this three hours for lack of water. Here was
plenty of it and the whole team rushed into the
sea only to find that this fluid which so much
resembled water was not the kind they were
accustomed to.</p>

<p>Now we were in real danger of getting drowned
or getting the wheels stuck in the quick-sand.
Frank suggested that we take the wheels off our
chariot, the way Pharaoh did and float ashore.
He was told to kulikuli and suggest some way
out of the difficulty which was feasible. All of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_77" id="page_77">[77]</a></span>
us knew how to direct the drivers however, and
if they had listened to us we would have been
there yet. Nui dashed into the water to seaward
of the cattle and striking one of the young leaders
on the nose it bellowed with pain and turned
shorewards and we were saved, probably for a
worse fate. We arrived safely at Wailuku and
hastened to relieve ourselves of the superfluous
real estate gathered on the way, for the winds of
Kahului isthmus can carry more red dirt per
cubic inch than any simoon in Arabia, and deposit
it more evenly on any obstructing surface.</p>

<p>That evening we met Lani and her mother at
the village store and postoffice and she soon became
the recipient of much in the line of bright
colored dress goods. Frank received a remittance
from home and nothing would do but he must
give her a side saddle, one of those fancy looking
horse-killers such as they sold for twenty dollars.
Joe bought her a fancy bridle and another member
of the party gave her a flaming scarlet felt
saddle cloth. All these to a poor girl who did
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_78" id="page_78">[78]</a></span>
not own a horse. Horses were pretty cheap in
those days, from $5 up. Frank bought her a
cream colored mare from a bystander for $20 and
placing the saddle and accoutrements on he requested
her to mount and try the saddle.</p>

<p>Shenandoah had been buying dress goods at
the instigation of Lani's mother and when he
came out and saw the beautiful girl mounted on
the prancing horse he swore she should never
ride it home and commanded her to dismount.</p>

<p>This revelation was too much for us. What;
this clod of earth dare to talk in this manner to
our Lani? And using tones of authority too!
This was the last straw. Frank opened up on
him with a volubility and a vocabulary which
could only have been acquired before the mast on
an American whaler.</p>

<p>Shenandoah dropped his armful of bundles and
made a rush at him to annihilate him. Frank had
played football too much in college to be badly
terrified and when the Portuguese struck at him
he lowered his head and rushed his black opponent,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_79" id="page_79">[79]</a></span>
taking him just in the short ribs with his
head, and Shenandoah was <i>hors de combat</i> instanter.
It was sometime before he could take a
breath, then had to be taken off to a room, which
he did not leave until we were ready to return to
Hoikaopuiaawalau.</p>

<p>Frank got a nice horse for himself and he and
Lani enjoyed the Fourth of July.</p>

<p>At that time there was a fashion among the
native women of making their own hats from
rooster skins. A fine bird would be selected, no
matter what the price ($5 has been paid for a
bird for that purpose). The skin was taken off
whole and while green put over a mold to dry.
Then they would line them and when rightly
made one could almost imagine it was a live
rooster sitting on a nest. Frank got one of the
best of these and gave it to Lani and the next day
as he and she rode on either side of the team,
for they drove us home, the sight of her was exceedingly
galling to Shenandoah who had to ride
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_80" id="page_80">[80]</a></span>
on the empty wagon, the cock appearing to crow
over him at every bounce of her horse.</p>

<p>However the fun was not out of us yet nor
out of the bullock. They never seemed to tire
giving us our money's worth. When we had
arrived at Wailuku we turned them into a corral
where there was plenty of food and drink and
they ought to have been satisfied. Not so however,
for, about midnight a man came to our lodgings
and said our cattle had got loose into the
cane fields, and, tired as we were we all had to
get out and hunt them through the cane, and
corral them once more.</p>

<p>We sailed across the plains easily enough but
when we came to the region of gulches and night
and the rain had set in the anxiety of those on
the wagon for their safety was pathetic. We had
some marvellous escapes but finally arrived in
camp in a half drowned condition.</p>

<p>A couple of days afterwards the charcoal
burner came over and told us that Leong Sing
had been there during our absence, and says he,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_81" id="page_81">[81]</a></span>
"there he comes again." That evening he called
on Lani and she flatly told him in some expressive
way that she wished no more of his attentions.
He retired to the Chinese camp and we
saw him no more.</p>

<p>The following day the Chinaman came over
and asked where Leong Sing was. We said we
did not know. Then said he, "he is dead for his
hat is lying beside the charcoal kiln and it looks
as if he had fallen in and been consumed." We
went over to see and things did have that appearance,
as the roof had fallen in and the pit was a
mass of flame. The Chinaman must have taken
the rejection of his suit very much to heart to
have destroyed himself by such a horrid route.</p>

<p>That same day Shenandoah rode off to Makawao
on Lani's horse and reported the death of
Leong Sing and swore out a complaint charging
Frank Willoughby with the murder.</p>

<p>A constable came over and took Frank away
and when the coroner's inquest was held the jury
returned a verdict: "died by the hands of some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_82" id="page_82">[82]</a></span>
one unknown to us." At the examination before
the magistrate Shenandoah and Joe Edwards
both swore to having repeatedly heard Frank
Willoughby threaten to kill the Chinaman and
the magistrate held Frank without bail to be tried
by the next Circuit Court at Lahaina. He was
taken off over the mountains by a policeman.
Joe Edwards skipped out for fear he might be
also arrested, for his threats were as pronounced
as Frank's.</p>

<p>When Frank and the guard got into Lahaina
he sent for an old friend of his father's who was
practicing law there and he persuaded the Circuit
Judge to accept bail as there had been no
body found and no cause for the calling of a
coroner's jury and that the magistrate merely
acted on the hearsay of a pair who were jealous
of the prisoner.</p>

<p>Frank went home with Farwell and the latter
advised him to return home to New York saying
that he had frequently written to him advising
such a course and his parents were exceedingly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_83" id="page_83">[83]</a></span>
anxious about him. Frank refused to skip his
bail and determined to stand trial like a man.</p>

<p>Within two weeks the Chinaman, Leong Sing,
came in with his uncle who had gone to search
into the matter and Frank was ordered discharged.
The Chinaman had felt so heartbroken
that he had wandered away up the ravine and
climbed up on a ridge and kept on walking until
he met a heavy shower and as it is pretty cold
up there he turned to go back. Unfortunately he
did not take the same ridge down, a thing likely
enough to occur, as he had walked so far as to
have passed the heads of several ravines, and
keeping too much to the right had brought up
the following night at Halehaku, some six miles
from his point of departure. The natives took
care of him and in a few days he was enabled
to get a horse and return to camp to the agreeable
surprise of the rest of us.</p>

<p>Frank took Mr. Farwell's advice and went
straight home to New York. Years afterwards
we were riding from Waihee to Lahaina by way
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_84" id="page_84">[84]</a></span>
of Kahakuloa and arriving at the latter village we
felt as if some fish and poi would taste good. It
was a dilapidated looking place and the shanties
were hardly improvements on pigsties, but we
decided that it was better to eat there than to
risk going farther and finding none.</p>

<p>We stopped at the best looking shanty and
were told they would prepare us some <i>opihi</i>, a
shell fish abundant on the rocks there, the sale
of which is about the only source of livelihood
of the few inhabitants.</p>

<p>Imagine our surprise when we were called to
eat to find that our hostess was none other than
Lani and that Shenandoah was our host and that
their eleven little black offsprings were the kids
we saw perched on the fence.</p>

<p>Lani was an old fagged out woman without
any traces of the belle she had been, and Shenandoah
was blacker and uglier than ever. "Apples
of Sodom," said my friend, and we paid for our
opihi and poi and departed."</p>

bove the long sloping hills of Kona
where the coffee grows luxuriantly,
on the stately mountain of Hualalai,
he lived, this Hiku I Kanahele.
That he existed there can be no
doubt, for the Kamaainas will tell
you the most remarkable stories concerning
him, which have been cherished with all the
old-time love of romance to the present matter-of-fact
age, handed down from generation
to generation. They will tell you also that his
father Ku was a Demi-God and his mother Hina
a Demi-Goddess, and will eagerly show you a romantic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_86" id="page_86">[86]</a></span>
relic of the past at the foot of the mountain,
the Ke Ana o Hina&mdash;Cave of Hina, and will
point out to you on the Kona coast, not far from
Kailua, with its soft, dreamy warm atmosphere
and enchanting bay, the palace where Hiku and
his bride resided.</p>

<p>Ku and Hina had two children: Hiku, kane,
and Kawelu, wahine, she being many years his
junior. Hiku, however, did not know of her existence,
for when a very little kaikamahine she
was given to the care of the brave Chief of Holualoa,
who reared her as his own child.</p>

<p>Beautiful as the sunrise was Kawelu, with eyes
as large, soft and brown as the heart of a sunflower,
tall, and graceful as the palms which swayed
in the murmuring breezes in her palace garden,
with a disposition sweet as the maile wreaths and
ohia leis her maidens wove to adorn her jet-black
hair, or wind around her willowy shapely form.</p>

<p>Many were the young chiefs who sought her
favors, but for all she had only smiles of friendship,
though at times, with the wanton coquetry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_87" id="page_87">[87]</a></span>
innate in the heart of every beautiful woman, she
would smile archly and invitingly upon some
handsome Alii, then regard him with a saucy indifference
which made her doubly precious in his
eyes. Agile as she was beautiful, her equal could
not be found throughout the Isle in athletic
games. Often, in the pastime of throwing the
spear, had she evaded half a dozen of these dangerous
weapons cast at her at once, catching
some with her hands, warding off or eluding the
others. None could hurl the arrows so dextrously
as she, nor ride so swiftly on the holua down
the steep hills, and few cared to leap from such
lofty rocks into the swollen streams; and she
would think it a light task to swim for miles upon
the gently swelling waters of the blue ocean, saying
with a merry laugh that the dreaded Mano
was her good friend. But the pastime she loved
best of all was surf riding, and so wondrously expert
was she in this exhilarating sport, and so
beautiful did she appear standing erect on her
board on the crest of an incoming wave, breaking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_88" id="page_88">[88]</a></span>
in snowy foam all around her, so like a radiant
Nymph or Goddess freshly risen from the seething
waters, that the onlookers would burst into
thunderous applause, calling her Kawelu the
Beautiful, which was borne echoing up the mountain
for many miles; and it was there in his home
on the mountain top that Hiku heard these
strange sounds wafted thither by the vagrant
winds. Often had he asked his mother what they
meant, but always evasive were her answers, for
well she knew, with her wonderful power of divining
the future, what the result would be if he
should know. But at last, so persistent were his
queries, she told him the sounds he heard were
the voices of the people, applauding the most
lovely wahine in all the world, praising her beauty
and skill as she rode on the waves, and that this
beautiful maiden was his own sister. Then a
great warm desire filled his breast, and he said:
"I must go to her; I must see this charming sister
of mine, and ride with her on the waves."
With commands and entreaties Hina endeavored
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_89" id="page_89">[89]</a></span>
to detain him, but to no purpose. Then she told
him they would fall in love with each other, and
that would bring great pilikia, for it was considered
then a proper thing for the chiefs to make
love to and marry their own sisters.</p>

<p>The next day Hiku departed for the coast with
a surf board made by his father. Being descended
from the Gods he had all their innate beauty
of form and cleverness; and the manner in which
he rode the waves called forth the plaudits of the
assembled crowd again and again.</p>

<p>Kawelu, who at this time was indolently lying
on the royal mats in the palace, her shapely form
being lomilomied by her attentive maids, inquired
why the people applauded so heartily, and on being
told there had come a stranger to the shore
as strong and graceful and athletic as a God, and
that he was riding her favorite nalu, which were
tabu to those not of Royal birth, hastily encircled
her slender waist with her pa'u, and with the Leipalaoa
around her neck (an ivory insignia of
royalty enclosed in human hair), hurried to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_90" id="page_90">[90]</a></span>
beach, and there upon the white gleaming crests
of her own nalu saw the most handsome youth
her liquid eyes smiled upon with a malo around
his loins, borne swiftly towards her, landing almost
at her feet. Their eyes met, and both stood
still as though transfixed by some delightful sensation,
then with a sudden joyous impulse she
took the Leipalaoa from her bosom and threw it
around his neck, expressing a desire for him, it
being a privilege, graciously accorded her royal
station, to ask whom she pleased to be her lover.
Hiku with all the fervor of the poetical nature
returned her impromptu affection, for she appeared
to him like one of his beautiful ancestors, who
were Gods and Goddesses, of whom Ku and Hina
had told him marvellous stories in his boyhood.</p>

<p>The happy lovers repaired to the Chief, the
foster father of Kawelu, and when he learned of
Hiku's exalted station readily gave consent to
their union.</p>

<p>Several months sped swiftly by, never had time
tripped along so merrily, his jaunty footsteps being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_91" id="page_91">[91]</a></span>
hastened by hilarious luaus where hulas were
sung and danced; and throughout the happy
period the two lovers nestled together like a pair
of cooing doves, never out of each other's presence.
None amongst the hundreds of guests
could dance the hulas with such ease and grace,
nor sing so harmoniously; and when linked arm
in arm as they rode on their surf boards on the
hissing breakers, their handsome forms erect and
stately, they seemed to the wondering gazers like
the offspring of the Gods from some mystic realm
beyond the waste of waters surrounding their
tranquil isle or from one of the millions of moving
worlds that shone above at night, which ever filled
them with awe and amazement.</p>

<p>But there comes a time in the sweetest moments
of our lives when the causes which induced
them cease to operate, when Love itself grows
tired of loving. Hiku had never before been so
long away from his parents, and having drank to
satiety of the love of his graceful Kawelu, a
strong yearning filled his heart to see his mother
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_92" id="page_92">[92]</a></span>
Hina, a yearning which increased daily, till at
length he told his affectionate bride that he must
leave her for awhile. With tears and entreaties
she implored him to stay, fearing this was a ruse
to abandon her, that he no longer wished her
caresses; but he became sullen and obstinate, and
one day at sunrise he stealthily left the couch of
his sweet young wife, whose eyes were softly
closed in blissful slumber.</p>

<p>Kawelu awoke; Hiku was gone, and whither?
Perhaps forever? These were the thoughts which
swiftly filled her mind, and caused her eyes to
weep rivers of tears. Then she wildly prayed to
the Gods to bring him back to her aching bosom,
and finding no response, set out alone along the
mountain trail towards his home, where she surmised
he was journeying. But Hiku with his
natural intuition knew of her design, and calling
to his aid the clouds he bade them intercept her
path, and the rain he bade fall to make slippery
the ground for her feet, and the branches of the
trees and the ferns and vines to detain her. Despite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_93" id="page_93">[93]</a></span>
these obstacles, with all Love's fond foolishness,
Kawelu followed her recreant lover for
many hours, to sink at last exhausted on the cold
wet earth, her soft skin torn by the thorny bushes
and branches of the ohias, and her long silken
hair tossed wildly around her form where the
ieie vine had clutched it as she passed. Salt tears
flowed from her eyes; her rosy morning dream of
Love had vanished, and the black despair of night
had taken its place. Calling loudly in the unbroken
silence of the forest for her lover, she
chanted the following lines pathetically:</p>

<p><span class="poem i2">Pii ana Hiku i ke kualono,</span><br />
<span class="poem i2">Ka lala e kau kolo ana;</span><br />
<span class="poem i2">I keekeehiia e ka ua,</span><br />
<span class="poem i2">Helelei ka pua ilalo,</span><br />
<span class="poem i2">E Hiku hoi e,</span><br />
<span class="poem i2">Hoi mai kaua e!</span></p>

<p>Which roughly translated are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="poem i2">Hiku has gone up the mountain,</span><br />
<span class="poem i2">Where the long winding branches are creeping,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_94" id="page_94">[94]</a></span>
<span class="poem i2">And the blossoms fall thickly around</span><br />
<span class="poem i2">Where the rain on the branches is weeping:</span><br />
<span class="poem i2">Oh Hiku! come back to me!</span></p>

<p>The radiant tropic morning has dawned, the
sun has kissed the raindrops from the faces of the
flowers, but on the sweet gentle face of Kawelu
the raindrops of her heart still fall unceasingly!
Vainly her father tries to soothe her grief, for he
had found her weeping and shivering on the lonely
mountain side; vainly her maids cluster around
with soft words of condolence. At length she
sleeps, and they leave her, praying to the Gods to
take away this great sorrow, to make her again
the warm ray of sunshine, gladdening all with
which it came in contact. When they returned
Kawelu was dead! Grieved beyond endurance by
her tragic loss she sought release in Death for
this maddening pain her heart could never hold,
fastening with her own <ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'gentlefingers'">gentle fingers</ins> around her
smooth round throat the death-inducing cord!</p>

<p>Hiku had greeted his mother Hina with a kiss,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_95" id="page_95">[95]</a></span>
but she bent upon him reproachful eyes, and said
"My son, you have killed your sister; already she
lies dead through loss of you! You must now go
and try to undo the great wrong you have committed."
Then Hiku in despair rushed down the
mountain accompanied by Ku, and reaching the
palace of his beautiful Kawelu found his mother's
words to be true, and with loud manifestations of
grief had her body placed in a dark cool room
which was tabu to all.</p>

<p>By his superior intuition Ku discerned Kawelu's
soul had gone to Aina Milu, a region of pleasure
in the underwood, a place where the spirits of
those who break Nature's laws go at death, where
no sun ever shines. The entrance to this realm
of shades he found to be in the fertile valley of
Waipio, and thither he and the now distracted
Hiku swiftly sped, gathering as they went the
Kowali vine, weaving of it a stout rope. On the
side of the valley they discovered a large hole
(pointed out by the natives to the present day)
which Ku said was the entrance to this darksome
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_96" id="page_96">[96]</a></span>
world of festive spirits. Hiku unwound his huge
coil of rope with the delicate blue and white Kowali
flowers entwined in its strands, and prepared
to descend into the dark pit. Previous to doing
so, however, he provided himself with an empty
cocoanut shell, and rubbed his body all over with
some rotten kukui nut oil, which emitted a most
offensive odor, and with a kukui nut for a light,
whilst Ku firmly held the rope, he descended into
the blackness.</p>

<p>On reaching the bottom he found himself in a
gloomy region amidst thorny trees without leaves
and fruit, dry and barren, with a close heavy
stifling atmosphere, whose odor excited the
senses and produced an intense thirst. Countless
numbers of spirits were gathered there, all active
and restless, engaged in the very games they were
fond of on earth. A great luau was being prepared,
where thousands of phantom pigs and
chickens were cooking in fires that gave no light.
The Demon King Milu was going that night to
marry a beautiful fresh young soul who had just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_97" id="page_97">[97]</a></span>
arrived in his weird realm; and looking towards
the throne of the king Hiku in dismay saw she
was none other than his own lost bride.</p>

<p>Much excitement was created by the presence
of Hiku, but he smelled so badly of the rotten
kukui nuts that the spirits did not care to approach
very closely, designing him "Ke akua
pilau,"&mdash;the bad smelling ghost.</p>

<p>The merry game of Kilu was going on at the
time, and in a few moments his presence was forgotten
in its absorbing delights. The game is
one of love, a wahine taking in her hand a small
ball, with which she endeavors to strike the kanaka
she desires, chanting at the same time a
verse of a song, and if successful he becomes her
immediate lover.</p>

<p>Kawelu was still seated on the elevated throne,
holding in her dainty fingers the little ball which
was the promoter of this intense merriment. Her
mobile lips were chanting a cooing refrain, one
which she and Hiku together had composed on
earth in the glad days of their <ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'grief'">brief</ins> wedded life.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_98" id="page_98">[98]</a></span>
In the midst of it she stopped, and he took up the
chant, all the others remaining silent, as the song
was unknown to them. Instantly she called in a
tremulous voice, "Who is this that sings;" as
though some forgotten memory had wakened in
her soul. No one spoke; then she left her place
and went amongst the throng, looking into each
face until she came to Hiku, who was crouching
low, when she stopped, but finding in him a bad-smelling
ghost she returned and recommenced
the chant. Again she paused a moment when
half through, and once more Hiku took up the refrain.
Kawelu was intensely agitated; this time
she observed it was the bad-smelling spirit who
chanted the remainder of her melody, and again
approached him, but he during this time had
made a swing of his long rope and was swiftly
swinging backwards and forwards, to the delight
of the clustering spirits who had never seen anything
of the kind before. "How smart the bad-smelling
ghost is," they said, whilst Kawelu clapped
her hands delightedly at the performance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_99" id="page_99">[99]</a></span>
expressing a desire to get on the swing; but Hiku,
disguising his voice, said "this is a very difficult
thing to learn; you might injure yourself
seriously if you tried it without my help; if you sit
in my lap I will swing you, then afterwards you
can swing by yourself." But the swinging spirit
smelled so strongly she would not accept his invitation
until they had placed a long wrapper
around him, when she did as he suggested.
Higher and higher Hiku sent the swing; with all
the strength of his nervy, muscular, frame he propelled
it back and forth, holding Kawelu close to
his heart the while, which was beating rapidly
with trembling hopes. Suddenly he pulled on the
rope, the signal agreed on with his father to haul
him up, and immediately, still moving in long
tremendous sweeps, the swing rose high in the
air, higher and higher each instant, amidst the
alarmed shouts of the subjects of Milu, whose
shrill cries echoed gruesomely along the avenues
of foliageless trees, "He is stealing the
King's wahine, he is stealing the King's wahine."
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_100" id="page_100">[100]</a></span>
Milu leaped madly forward to snatch
her from his arms, but slipped on the Kilu
ball, which lay on the ground, he fell heavily
forward, and was trampled under the feet of his
excited minions, and swift as were their movements,
the marvellous strength of Ku, hauling up
the swing, was more availing, for it shot up the
black shaft with lightning rapidity, the startled
Kawelu struggling wildly to escape, Hiku clasping
her tightly to his breast, holding her easily in
his strong grasp, chanting some mystic words
whereby she became smaller and smaller, until
he held her in the hollow of his hand, when he
forced her into the empty cocoanut shell, and
holding his fingers firmly over the hole safely returned
to earth, glad to escape from the gloom of
this underworld of <ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'unyholesome'">unwholesome</ins> mirth and ceaseless
revelry. Quickly they turned their faces towards
Hualalai, looking in the distance like a
dark ominous shadow, and before many hours
their anxious feet echoed in the chamber where
lay the mute body of Kawelu, still under strict
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_101" id="page_101">[101]</a></span>
tabu, no dog having barked in the vicinity of its
sacred precincts, nor foot of man passed by the
spot, since their departure.</p>

<p>The spirit leaves the body through the eyes,
through the little holes in the corners of the eyes
nearest the nose, when Death calls it. This Ku
and Hiku knew, but they also knew that the spirit
cannot return in the same manner, that it must
find its way, if ever it returns, into its earthly tenement
of flesh and blood through the hollow in the
sole of the foot. Placing the cocoanut there, and
removing his finger from the hole, Hiku commanded
the spirit of his beloved Kawelu to enter
her body, lying there so pathetically cold and still
that the tears sprang to his eyes as he gazed.
The spirit went as far as the knee, when it returned;
again he commanded it to enter, and this
time it went to the hip, but could go no further.
Once again he commanded the spirit to seek an
entrance, and with fluttering heart and motionless
limbs awaited the outcome of those terribly
anxious moments, for well he knew how many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_102" id="page_102">[102]</a></span>
were the chances of the soul being lost in the intricate
channels of the body, then to his unbounded
joy he perceived a slight pulsing movement of
the eyelids, then a gradual unveiling of her liquid
dark-brown orbs, as she murmured, "Why did
you wake me; I had so pleasant a sleep; why did
you not let me rest;" but when she felt the warm-impassioned
kisses of her lover on her cold lips,
and heard his voice sounding in her ears like rare
music she vaguely remembered having heard before
under sweet conditions, breathing protestations
of affection and love, and when his warm
tears of joyous thankfulness fell on her smooth
<ins title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'velvetry'">velvety</ins> cheek, she awoke to a full realization of
the tranquil bliss of love, of the delicious unspeakable
harmony poets vainly endeavor to describe,
remembering vividly the weird events of the past
few days, and her arms twined lovingly around
the form of her own Hiku, on whose trembling
bosom she softly nestled.</p>

<p>Centuries have passed; Hiku and Kawelu no
longer exist on this plane of action, but whilst the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_103" id="page_103">[103]</a></span>
Hawaiian race endures will live the story of their
love, and the spectral past with its warriors and
gods, and its warm love and worship and
song and story will ever be brilliantly reflected
in their hearts. The lovers lived to a mellow
old age, ever faithful to each other,
blessed with a numerous offspring, from whom
the kings of Hawaii claimed descent. And
the old kamaainas will earnestly tell you that
every bit of this romantic story is absolutely true.</p>

hree riders came out of the woods,
and, turning into the road leading
from Napoopoo to the uplands,
slowly began the ascent. As they
went up, the long plains, reaching
from the forest covered heights
of Mauna Loa to the ocean, seemed to grow
broader, and the sea rose higher, till the far
away horizon almost touched the sinking sun.
Lanes of glassy water stretched from the shore
into illimitable distance. A ship lying motionless
looked as if hanging in mid-air. Under the
cliff the delicate lines of cocoanut and palm trees
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_105" id="page_105">[105]</a></span>
were silhouetted against the ocean mirror. Far
to the south ran the black and frowning coast, relieved
here and there by white lines of foam
creeping lazily in from the ocean, only to look
darker as the surf melted from sight. On the
plain, little clusters of trees, or a house, or a thin
curl of smoke, indicated the presence of men:
and back of all rose the forest, vast, dim and mysterious,
stretching away for miles till lost in the
clouds resting softly on the bosom of the mountain.</p>

<p>Such a scene could not fail to arrest attention,
and, though our riders were tired, they reined in
their horses to enjoy its quiet beauty.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful scene! I have been through
Europe, feasted my eyes on the Alps, and have
seen the finest that America can produce, but I
never saw its equal," said the tourist.</p>

<p>"It looks as if such a picture might be the
theatre of thrilling romance and history" said
the Coffee Planter. "Is it not here that Captain
Cook was killed? And I think I have heard that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_106" id="page_106">[106]</a></span>
a famous battle was fought somewhere near: the
last struggle of the past against advancing Christianity."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Native, slowly, with a lingering
look in his eyes, as he turned from the inspiring
view to his companions. "Yes, this is all
historic ground. Over there under the setting
sun, at Kuamoo, was fought the battle of Kekuaokalani,
and there a heroic woman braved and
met death with her husband, a rebel chief. On
these plains below and on yonder heights there
have been many thrilling scenes in Hawaii's history.
But all of the romance is not in the past.
Do you see those houses away down the coast,
this side of the high lands of Honokua? See
how they glow in the setting sun-light. That is
Hookena, and only a few years ago it witnessed
the last act in a simple drama, which can hardly
be excelled in all the tales of heroism in the past.
It was told me in part by the woman who was or
is the heroine, for she yet lives. And I looked at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_107" id="page_107">[107]</a></span>
her in wonder, because she was so unconscious
of it all."</p>

<p>"Let us hear the story," said the Planter. "We
will sit on that high point and watch this glorious
scene fade into moonlight, while we rest and
listen." They dismounted and stepped from the
road to a projecting rock and, throwing themselves
on the grass where none of the wonderful
vision could be missed, listened. The Native
looked a little embarrassed at his sudden transformation
from guide to story-teller, but accepted
the position and began.</p>

<p>"Many years ago a native family lived a few
miles above Hookena, on land which had been
occupied by their ancestors for generations, for
they belonged to the race of chiefs. The house
was hidden from the road, in the midst of a grove
of orange, bread-fruit, mango, banana and other
trees. It is on storied ground, for many stirring
events in the past history of Hawaii had occurred
here. A son and three daughters were the children.
They received more than the usual care and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_108" id="page_108">[108]</a></span>
attention given to Hawaiian children, and had
grown to man and womanhood serious and reflective.
The young man, Keawe, was filled with
a desire to do something noble for his dying race.
Though he had travelled over the Islands and
had been well received everywhere, yet he was
heart-free, and said he would never marry, but
wait untrammelled till his time for action should
come. With eagerness he watched political developments
at the capital. His heart beat wildly
when the last Kamehameha died, and Kalakaua
was elected King. Such a method of King-making
did not suit his chivalric ideas. The records
of personal prowess, of brave chiefs and noble
women were his delight. He mourned that such
records belonged to the well nigh forgotten past.
His ambition was not ignoble. He wanted the
Hawaiians to be worthy of the best civilization,
to maintain a Hawaiian kingdom, because that
the native was equal to it. While he mourned,
he condemned the frequent failures, under which
the native was forfeiting the confidence of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_109" id="page_109">[109]</a></span>
white friends. He was one of the overwhelming
majority who regarded Kalakaua's accession as
unworthy, and as the beginning of the end of
Hawaiian supremacy.</p>

<p>One day, while fishing at the beach where he
was doing more dreaming than fishing; sometimes
idly watching a laughing company of girls
who were bathing and surf-riding; he was startled
by a cry of terror. Springing to his feet, he saw
that one of the girls was desperately struggling
to swim ashore, where her affrighted companions
were running wildly about crying for help.
Looking toward the sea he saw a large fin on the
surface rapidly following the swimmer. Accustomed
to every athletic sport; perfectly at home
in the water; always cool and self possessed, he
saw, that to overtake her, the shark must pass a
low rocky headland, and in an instant he was
there with a long knife in his hand. He remembered
seeing the face of the girl as she struggled
desperately to escape. There was a single terrified
glance, but he saw a beautiful woman, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_110" id="page_110">[110]</a></span>
face indicating a higher type than usual. There
was no time for admiration. The shark was turning
and, with a horrid open mouth, was about to
rush upon its victim. He gave a loud shout,
jumped full upon the huge beast, and in an instant
had plunged his knife to the hilt again and
again into its body. Then he was hurled into the
seething brine, as the frightened animal with
frantic plunges rushed seaward. Coming to the
surface and looking about he saw the body of the
girl near by. He thought her dead. She was
indeed stunned and hurt, for the shark gave her
a fearful blow in turning. It was the work of
only a minute to drag her out. There for a
moment he saw the full measure of her youth and
beauty, but did not wait for returning consciousness.
Seeing that she was recovering he walked
swiftly away.</p>

<p>But he was wounded, and, denounce and reproach
himself as he would, the sweet face ever
and anon came before his eyes, and sent the blood
tingling and dancing through his veins. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_111" id="page_111">[111]</a></span>
tried to crush out the image, and determined to
enter into active life; to cease dreaming, and begin
then and at once to accomplish his high aims.</p>

<p>The political campaign, culminating in the
election of 1886, had commenced. Kalakaua had
announced the aim of his reign: to increase and
develope the Hawaiian people. "Hawaii for the
Hawaiians" made an inspiring war cry. Keawe
entered with energy and hope into the conflict.
Yet it troubled him, and it seemed as if there was
something wrong in opposing the noble Pilipo,
who had so long faithfully represented the people
of Kona in the National Legislature. But Kalakaua
declared that Pilipo must be replaced by
another man, and was himself coming to assist
in the conflict. With the ancient faith and confidence
in the chief, Keawe put aside his doubts
and worked day and night for the success of the
holy cause. It was holy to him and as the day of
election drew near, his belief grew stronger, that
at last a deliverer had come and Hawaii was to
be redeemed. Already he saw, in a bright future,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_112" id="page_112">[112]</a></span>
a government by Hawaiians with full friendship
for all nations, and cordial relations with those
who had helped his people into the best light of
civilization. The King came, and with him a
troop of palace guards from Honolulu. When
all of these were, by the royal will, duly registered
as voters, and means, other than argument
and persuasion, were used to help on the good
cause, a chilly sense of something wrong cooled
Keawe's ardor. He met the King and was cordially
received. His heart bounded with pleasure
at words of praise for his work. An invitation to
a feast and dance was accepted, and only when
he went and saw, did he realize the mockery and
sham behind the fine words. Heart sick, dizzy
with a sore disappointment, early the next morning,
when all were sleeping, he mounted his horse
and stole away, alone. The cold mountain air
relieved the pain in his head, but his heart was
weary and the future looked dark. He saw that
if there was momentary triumph, all the sooner
disaster must come; and he longed to know how
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_113" id="page_113">[113]</a></span>
to avert the danger. He grew weary thinking
and trying to hope, and his thoughts went to
other things. Again he was in the water, struggling
to save her life. Again the sweet face appeared
before him, so fair and gentle. The sun
was hot now; he had ridden for hours, and,
alighting, threw himself on the grass and looked
up through the leafy bower at the bright sky.
Perhaps he slept; at any rate he dreamed that a
sweet voice was singing "Aloha oe." He sat up
and listened. It was not a dream, and a strong
desire to see the face of the singer possessed him.
The voice drew nearer, then she passed near by
carrying a pitcher, and went to a spring. It was
the girl he had saved from the shark! She wore a
loose flowing gown of white, and a maile branch
twisted about her head hardly confined the silky
hair which floated down her back. A coral pin
held the gown at her neck. Short sleeves only
partly hid her graceful and shapely arms.</p>

<p>Keawe arose and stood watching. His heart
beat tumultuously.  No other woman had so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_114" id="page_114">[114]</a></span>
strongly moved him, and now he would speak
and not run again. A movement startled her,
and rising with the dripping pitcher in her hand,
she turned and saw him. That she knew him
was instantly evident; but her eyes modestly
dropped and she moved as if to go. But he was
in the path, and, seeing that, she hesitated and
turned to go through the woods, but could not
and stood again, looking at her feet which just
peeped from below the gown. Keawe stepped
towards her and said, "Do you remember
the shark?" "Yes, I know you," she replied.
Her eyes said more and he saw it again. As he
stepped nearer she said, "Why did you not let
me thank you? I thought you might come." It
flashed through his mind that he had wasted two
months pursuing an ignis fatuus, only to have
nothing but bitterness at the end, when it might
have been &mdash;&mdash;! "I was afraid to come,"
he replied. "I wanted to work for Hawaii and
our people." "Yes, I know," she said. "You
have spoken bravely. All Kona trusts in your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_115" id="page_115">[115]</a></span>
words!" "Did you believe them?" he quickly
asked. "Do you believe in <i>me</i>?" A look was
her reply. "Will you believe in me if I say that
I have done with 'Hawaii for the Hawaiians', under
such leadership?" "I will always believe in
you. But come, you are tired. My father will be
glad to meet you," she said quickly. "May I
drink?" he said, and held out his hand. She
gave him the pitcher, which he held and looked
at the pretty figure standing near the spring.
"You are Rebecca at the well." "And are you
Abraham's servant?" "No, I am Isaac himself,"
he replied and tried to take her hand. "Oh! but
Isaac did not meet Rebecca at the well!" And,
laughing merrily, she ran down the path towards
her home. He followed but though he wanted,
the opportunity for other words did not come;
she was so coy.</p>

<p>It was not the only visit. Very often did business
calls take him along that lovely mountain
road and there was always a welcome at the home
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_116" id="page_116">[116]</a></span>
of Lilia. He told her of his love, and in April
they were married.</p>

<p>They built a little cottage which nestled snugly
in a quiet valley on the mountain side, and there
they passed a few months of perfect happiness.
All loved them. He was regarded as the wise
adviser and friend of the country-side. She became
the gentle sister of those who were ill, or
suffering or wayward, and their home was the
center of an influence which helped and lifted.</p>

<p>But a shadow came into their lives. He grew
silent, reserved, almost afraid of his beautiful Lilia.
She watched with eager anxiety and entreated
his confidence, but his lips were sealed.
Only his tremulous voice and shaking hand betrayed
suffering. Sometimes she fancied that his
hands grew palsied and his bright eye was dim,
but repelled the fancy with terror. One day he
came home with such a look that her heart stood
still, and words died upon her lips. He gazed
into her eyes with passionate agony and, taking
her hands, said "Will you still believe in me if I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_117" id="page_117">[117]</a></span>
say we must part; that I must leave you and go
away, and you must stay here and live out your
life&mdash;your precious life, so dear to me&mdash;all, all
alone?" Then her courage came, and she said,
"No, I will never leave you. You are mine. I
must go too, wherever you go!" "But," said he,
"I have seen the examining surgeon to-day, and
he says that I must go by the next trip of the
steamer to Honolulu." And then the full measure
of her woe dawned upon the stricken wife.
With unutterable anguish she threw her arms
about his body and clasped him tightly to her
breast. "I was allowed to come here and prepare
to go, and to bid a last farewell to all I hold so
dear. I shall never see these trees, the flowers,
this house, my friends, nor you, my precious wife,
again." But her face had grown hard and stern,
and, relaxing her hold, she told her plan. It was
to take him into a far off deep recess in the
woods. There was up the mountain side a deep
crater, overgrown with trees, ferns, vines and a
wild luxuriance of growth, which kindly nature
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_118" id="page_118">[118]</a></span>
had draped so softly that its hideousness was lost.
It was considered inaccessible, and only the
family knew of an ancient lava cavern which entered
its deepest recess. One of several mouths
of the cavern was near the house. "But the law
says that I must go," he urged. "There is no law
higher than my love for you," and he yielded to
her imperious urgency. Quickly and stealthily
she carried there such articles as the simplest life
might require, and a few days later, when the officers
of the law came, Keawe was not to be found
and no one knew where they had gone.</p>

<p>With untiring love the wife watched and aided
her husband. Together they built a little bower
out of view from the upper edges of the crater,
under the spreading branches of a kukui tree.
A little pool, fed by the constant drip from the
over-hanging wall, supplied them with pure
water. Near at hand, under a mass of ferns,
maile and ieie, was the mouth of the cavern. She
grew familiar with its turns and windings, till
she almost dared to brave its black recesses without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_119" id="page_119">[119]</a></span>
a torch. In one of its dry and sheltered windings,
she stored articles of food and clothing,
thinking that sometime a watch might be stationed
at the home on the hill-side, and she could
not venture out. But days melted into weeks;
weeks became months: two years passed, and
their hiding place was not discovered. No one
came, though Keawe often longed to see the faces
of friends. But they were afraid to venture near
and the cavern echoed only to her feet, and the
silence of the deep pit was only broken by their
voices and the music of birds. At times, a sudden
gust rushed down the steep sides and every
tree waved and bowed its head, and the leaves
of the banana rustled and quivered. The sun-light
only touched the bottom in summer and
then for a few minutes only. But it was not
gloomy, the glorious sky was always there and
the brilliant light, and bloom and fragrance filled
the air. No, it was not always bright, sometimes
tempests whirled far over their heads; trees in the
world above tossed their branches over the abyss,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_120" id="page_120">[120]</a></span>
leaves and twigs fell gently, or branches, and
once, a tree, were hurled down with deafening
noise. The roar of thunder, and vast sheets and
torrents of rain filled the pit. Once, in a still
night, they were startled and terrified by a sudden
boom far below their feet and the earth
shook, stones rattled down the rocky sides of the
abyss, and they remembered the dread power of
the volcano. "It is Pele! she is angry with us!"
cried Lilia. "No," replied her husband, "we
have thrown ourselves into the protecting bosom
of the Goddess! We are safe in her arms." They
were safe from human sight and interference,
and Lilia's soul feasted in the presence of him she
loved. She poured out upon him such a wealth
of devotion, that a miser might have envied. But
alas, though safe from man, he was under the fell
power of disease, and slowly yielded. Day after
day he grew weaker and less able to help himself,
until the fond wife performed the most menial
tasks. But they were not menial to her. Every
thing for him was a glory and a joy.</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_121" id="page_121">[121]</a></span>

<p>"I cannot last long," he said one day, "and I
want you to have my lands. Get your mother's
young husband, the lawyer, to come, that it may
be settled." He came, and, looking wonderingly
about, prepared a deed which he said would accomplish
the object. Keawe was not satisfied.
"It sounds wrong&mdash;why should the name of your
wife appear?<ins title="Transcriber's note: quotation mark added">"</ins> he asked. "She is your wife's
mother," was the reply, "and you cannot convey
to your wife direct. When this deed is recorded
my wife can then convey to your wife. You must
hurry or it will be too late," said the coming man.
With some doubt still, but trusting to his friend's
good faith, knowing he was alone cut off from all
the world, Keawe signed, and the deed was taken
away. Patiently they waited for weeks to finish
the business, "and then," said Keawe, "you will
have a home." But the lawyer did not come, and
evaded Lilia's eager questions.</p>

<p>One day when returning to the cavern, her
heart stood still as she saw slowly emerging from
its mouth, several police officers, bearing on a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_122" id="page_122">[122]</a></span>
rough litter the helpless form of her beloved Keawe.
At a glance she saw the whole base deception.
Her step-father had betrayed their secret
hiding place, and the end had come! With a
frantic wail of despair, she flung herself at their
feet and begged and implored. But her entreaties
were vain, and the sick man was taken to
Hookena where the steamer was waiting. At
the landing, as the boat drew near the shore, she
learned that he was to go alone and then her
grief knew no bounds. As he was put on board
and turned imploring eyes on her, she made a
desperate attempt to go too, and in her struggle
her clothing was almost torn away. The officers
of the law thought they were doing their duty,
but their eyes were full of pity. "Keawe! Oh
Keawe, my beloved husband!" she cried, "let me
go with you!" But no answer came. The steamer
turned her head towards the sea, and he was
gone. She fell to the earth, and lay with buried
face for many minutes. It seemed to her that
nothing was left and bitterly she mourned her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_123" id="page_123">[123]</a></span>
loss. But suddenly starting, she asked eagerly
for a horse, which was furnished at once by a
sympathetic friend. Mounting, she went without
stopping for rest or food until, on the second day,
Kawaihae was reached. Soon a steamer came,
and she went to Honolulu, only to hear on landing
that Keawe had died on the trip down. Giving
way to despair, she dejected sought the house
of an aunt, where she was kindly received, and
there she remained for several months."</p>

<p>"And that is the story," said the Native.</p>

<p>"It is rather sad, but she was a heroine sure
enough," said the Planter.</p>

<p>The pale light of the crescent moon served
only to render the landscape shadowy. All nature
rested: An owl fluttered slowly by and a soft
murmur from far below told that the restless sea
alone moved. There was no other sound. The
riders mounted and silently stole away.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
